Herr [[Vinzenz Fromm]], field archaeologist


and [[Feldwebel Berend Voss]], the group’s “minder”.

As the introductions are concluded, two more guests
are ushered into the room:

a petite woman in a dress uniform and a rather plain looking, bespectacled man.
They are introduced as Lt. Philippa Richards of the US Navy and Mr. Timothy Jones of the AMS Mining Corporation.
