An **Atash Behram** (Fire of Victory) is the highest grade of fire that can be placed in a [Zoroastrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism") [fire temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_temple "Fire temple") as an [eternal flame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_flame "Eternal flame"). The other two lower graded fires are Atash Adaran and below Adaran is the Atash Dadgah; these three grades signify the degree of reverence and dignity these are held in. The establishment and consecration of the Atash Behram fire is the most elaborate of all [the grades of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_temple#Classification "Fire temple"). It involves the gathering of 16 different types of fire, including fire by lightning (i.e. gathering up any branch of tree ignited by a lightning strike), fire from a cremation pyre, fire from trades where a furnace is operated, and fires from the hearths as is also the case for the Atash Adaran. Each of the 16 fires is then subject to a purification ritual before it joins the others. A large team of priests are required for the purification and consecration ceremonies, which can take up to a year to complete.
