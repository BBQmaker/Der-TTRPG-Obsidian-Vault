Weissler shuts himself away for six months to examine the carvings, taking no interest in the leadership of Black Sun and leaving Prior Wolff to administer in his place. In his absence, grasping her opportunity to conduct her own investigations, Mina loses no time in opening the archives to study the many artefacts previously consigned to gather dust in the vaults beneath Wewelsburg.
With the full resources of Black Sun at her disposal, Mina’s new policy quickly succeeds as her experimentation leads to the development of a complex serum with the power to revivify inanimate tissue (p.235). The sudden reanimation of the flesh, and its spread to other samples at terrifying speed, claims the lives of three researchers before the contagion can be contained by troops armed with Flammenwerfer 35 flamethrowers.
[[Mina Wolff]] quickly covers up the incident and [[Reinhardt Weissler]] remains unaware, locked as he is in deep contemplation in his chambers. Recreating the experiment, but with far greater care and caution, she is able to manufacture a crude aerosol version of the serum, to be delivered by artillery shell or bomb. Realising Weissler’s likely anger at her disregard for his orders, Mina chooses to gamble everything on her weapon.
Claiming to speak for Weissler, she arranges a demonstration of the serum on the Baltic island of Peenemünde. While many of the Nazi High Command look on in horror at the
shuddering nightmare of flesh, bone, and sinew that crawls across the test ground before them, the Führer gazes down in rapt fascination bordering on glee. When [[Reinhardt Weissler|Weissler]] finally
hears of the experiment, his fury is terrible but Mina has, by her actions, placed herself beyond his reach. Even the Maste of the Black Sun cannot risk openly punishing her now that
she enjoys Hitler’s personal favour. Protected by [[Adolf Hitler|the Führer’s]]’s patronage, Mina is free to pursue her own technological agenda and with Krafft Heimberg (her chief scientist) in tow, departs from Wewelsburg and Black Sun. Nachtwölfe has been born.
