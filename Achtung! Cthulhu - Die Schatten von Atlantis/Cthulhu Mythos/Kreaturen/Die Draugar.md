Created by [[Nachtwölfe]] through the combination of formulae and compounds recovered from the Dutch East Indies and North Africa, interwoven with some of the more controversial work of the American scientist Dr. Herbert West, der Draugr can best be described as a biological weapon (typically delivered as a gas via artillery or dropped munitions) which causes the uncontrolled reanimation of dead tissue. Living flesh that comes into contact with this abomination rapidly becomes necrotic, and limbs affected in this manner must be amputated to prevent further spread. Die Draugar possess no intelligence but are able to sense living matter and attempt to add it to their overall mass.
Unlike Black Sun’s creations, die Draugar cannot be controlled or commanded in any form and is only used in enemy-controlled territory for fear of it attacking friendly forces. With no central nervous system or brain, die Draugar are extremely difficult to destroy—pieces hacked from the main body will continue to attack, with fire-based weapons being the only effective deter- rents against its mindless acquisition of new tissue. With the D-Day landings in Normandy, the SS have proposed launching the weapon against Allied field hospitals behind the front lines to act as both an effective shock weapon and to break the morale of troops witnessing the horrific destruction reaped by these abominations.

Appearance: in contrast to the zombie-like Gefallenen of Black Sun, die Draugar do not maintain their original form but are composed of tissue, muscle, cartilage, and bone fused together in an abhorrent, writhing mass that pulls itself across the ground using appendages formed from its overall seething bulk.
