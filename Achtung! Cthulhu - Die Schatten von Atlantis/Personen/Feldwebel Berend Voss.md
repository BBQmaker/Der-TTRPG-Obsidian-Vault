### Feldwebel Berend Voss, Nachtwölfe Field Security

A former French Foreign Legion soldier, Voss comes to
Nachtwölfe by a strange and circuitous route after his platoon
stumble into an encounter between Wolff’s men and some-
thing evil and unpleasant deep in the deserts of North Africa. Badly injured in the ensuing firefight, Voss is one of the few
survivors, and the only one from the Legion. His bravery and
determination mark him out as a person of interest to the
German officer in command of the mission, who orders him
to be recovered alongside Nachtwölfe’s own troops.
Patched up by the field medics at Adlerhorst (Nachtwölfe’s
secret base in Tunisia; see Achtung! Cthulhu: the Guide to
North Africa for more details) Voss pledges his allegiance to
the German outfit which saves his life. He is, at heart, a sol-
dier, and as long as there is someone issuing him with orders,
he does not really care what the greater picture might be.
Whilst he is aware of the underlying reason for his current
assignment, he is there to do his job and protect his charges;
anything else, he will leave to the boffins.

Appearance: The Feldwebel’s skin shows signs of a faded
suntan, and his tendency to squint even when not in bright
light suggests that he has spent quite some time in sunnier
climes than his native Germany. Voss’ otherwise impassive
features give little away and his movements are precise and
deliberate, leaving the lingering impression of a tightly
coiled spring upon all those who meet him. He says little,
preferring actions to words.
