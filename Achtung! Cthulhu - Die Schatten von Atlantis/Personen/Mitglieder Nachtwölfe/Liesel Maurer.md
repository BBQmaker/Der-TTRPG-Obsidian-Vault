# Liesel Maurer, Head Of Projekt Atlantis

No-one would accuse Liesel Maurer of being a daydreamer by looking at her, yet further evidence (if it was needed) that you should never judge a book by its cover. Beneath her studious and hard-working exterior beats the heart of a romantic; one which she has kept carefully hidden away from public view since childhood. Maurer always loved the stories of the Nordic and Germanic gods, and tried to make her older brothers act them out when they played together. But they always made her be the monster, never a god or goddess, and eventually she gave up, preferring to hide herself away in her father’s extensive (though rarely used) library instead.
As the daughter of a very minor Teutoburg noble, Maurer’s life at the family’s ancestral schloss was otherwise comfortable. She often roamed the woods around the estate, partly to get away from her brothers, but also to visit the nearby Hermann Monument, just outside the town of Detmold. There she fantasised about the ancient Germanic king, Arminius (Hermann), and his defeat of Rome’s finest at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9AD.
When she became older and was allowed to travel further on her own, Maurer would often make “shopping” trips to Bad-Meinburg or Horn so that she could visit the Externsteine, alighting at the convenient tram stop beside Germany’s Stonehenge. She no longer had to hide her visits after the Nazis came to power; her father’s desire to be thought of as a good German ensured many family excursions to this important (if unsubstantiated) symbol of
nationalist pagan pride.
Entirely self-taught, over the years Maurer became an expert on lost cultures and pagan mythology, carefully hiding her interests behind the façade of a dutiful daughter.
Her article on Atlantis, sent to one of Germany’s many occult magazines, brought her to the attention of [[Mina Wolff]], who invited her to a meeting clandestinely described as an interview for a secretarial job in order to deflect Herr Maurer’s potential objections.
And so Maurer found herself officially working as a “personal assistant” to one of Wolff’s lieutenants, a position she very quickly rose to enjoy for herself. Her drive and determination, coupled with her devotion to Wolff, saw her vigorously competing with her fellow Obersts of the Inner Circle for control of Projekt Atlantis. She is convinced she will succeed in her quest to recover the [[Palladion]], one way or another.

## Appearance:
The shadow to the light that is the petite blonde, Mina Wolff, Maurer is practically her superior’s opposite when it comes to their physical appearance.
Although Liesel attempts to mimic Mina’s trademark hairstyle, scraping her thick black hair back from her face only makes her look severe (which can be useful when it comes to intimidating people). She dresses in well-tailored clothing which accentuates her considerable curves.
