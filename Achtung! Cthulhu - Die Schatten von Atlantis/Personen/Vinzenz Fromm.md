Herr Vinzenz Fromm, Feldarchäologe
und Nachtwölfe Feldforscher

Originally an independent treasure hunter for hire, after a
run of bad luck and narrow escapes (from angry officials who
objected to his thievery and clients who objected to seeing
no return on their investments), Fromm has found himself in
the unlikely position of working for Nachtwölfe.
Keen to maintain his ability to travel the world on
someone else’s money, Fromm has hitched himself to an
organisation he thinks will give him the lifestyle and fame
notoriety he desires, even if he has little belief in their
underlying aims. He has, however, become somewhat
obsessed with Atlantis since joining Mina Wolff’s forces
and is convinced that the secrets of the lost civilisation will
guarantee him fortune and glory. Like Armbruster, he knows
exactly why the group is in Peru.

Appearance: For Faramund Armbruster, looking at
Vinzenz Fromm is unnervingly like looking in the mirror
twenty-five years ago, back before time caught up with
him. The younger man is far cockier though, and much
more hands-on, than Armbruster ever was when it comes
to his “research”. He walks with a distinct swagger, his
chin resolutely thrust forward ready to meet whichever fist
might be aiming for it this time.
