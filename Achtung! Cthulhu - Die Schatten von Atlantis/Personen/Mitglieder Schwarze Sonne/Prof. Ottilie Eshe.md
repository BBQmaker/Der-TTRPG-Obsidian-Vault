# Prof. Ottilie Eshe, Black Sun Field Co-ordinator
[[Prof. Ottilie Eshe|Prof. Eshe]] always dreamed of finding something important that would make her name in academic circles. Sadly, her talents have never quite been up to the task of uncovering such wonders; instead, they lie somewhere else entirely. Magically gifted, Eshe uses her “skills” to nevertheless rise steadily if unspectacularly through her field before she is discovered by Astrid Urner, Prior of the Black Sun (KG, pp.89-90) and recruited into the [[Hexenzirkel]], Black Sun’s specialist magical division.
A clever manipulator of people, [[Prof. Ottilie Eshe|Prof. Eshe]] always seems very friendly and polite but is not one to let an opportunity for self-advancement pass her by. She has not been inducted into the ranks of those who know the true secret behind [[Reinhardt Weissler|Reinhardt Weissler’s]] organisation but she is confident that her association with the Order can only bring her power and prestige, particularly as she knows that the Exarch has the Reichsführer-SS’ ear. With the outbreak of war, [[Prof. Ottilie Eshe|Prof. Eshe]] has gone to ground with her Black Sun fieldworkers, reluctant to abandon her work as artefact recovery co-ordinator for the Nile Valley and Delta. Originally based in Cairo, the Professor and her small team shelter with local Nazi sympathisers in towns and villages all along the river, always one step ahead of anyone who comes looking for them.
Eshe’s feelings towards [[Dr. Reid Ystenson]] (p.97) are complex; after all, the young man’s work has certainly helped her to advance her own career. She is fond of him in the same
way a maiden aunt might be fond of a distant nephew, but also deeply jealous of his academic talents. She regrets the schism between them that has led to him joining Nachtwölfe, but she is sure that it is just an attempt to prove a point and that he will see the error of his ways sooner rather than later.

## Appearance: 
Quite tall and spry for her advancing years, [[Prof. Ottilie Eshe]] is tanned and weather-beaten from several decades of working on dig sites under the fierce African In reality, a deep-seated rivalry and mistrust exists between Nachtwölfe and Black Sun in North Africa sun. Her fingernails are permanently ingrained with dirt and she has a tendency to squint thanks to so much bright sunlight. Her dark hair is unruly and barely restrained by a tight, old-fashioned bun and a floppy sunhat that has definitely seen better days. Dressing practically when in the field, she is also well aware that first impressions count and always rises to the occasion when not on a dig.
