#### Armor Class

Objects are easier to hit than creatures because they don’t usually move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An object’s [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Armor_Class) is equal to 10 + its size modifier (see [Table: Size and Armor Class of Objects](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects/#Table_Size_and_AC_of_Objects)) + its [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Dexterity_Dex) modifier. An inanimate object has not only a [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Dexterity_Dex) of 0 (–5 penalty to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Armor_Class)), but also an additional –2 penalty to its [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Armor_Class). Furthermore, if you take a full-round action to line up a shot, you get an automatic hit with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls with a ranged weapon.


#### Ranged Weapon Damage

Objects take half damage from ranged weapons (unless the weapon is a [siege engine](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/siege-engines/) or something similar). Divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the object’s hardness.
