### Overland Movement

Characters covering long distances cross-country use overland movement. Overland movement is measured in miles per hour or miles per day. A day represents 8 hours of actual travel time. For rowed watercraft, a day represents 10 hours of rowing. For a sailing ship, it represents 24 hours.

_Walk_: A character can walk 8 hours in a day of travel without a problem. Walking for longer than that can wear him out (see Forced March, below).

_Hustle_: A character can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour of hustling. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from hustling becomes fatigued.

A fatigued character can’t run or charge and takes a penalty of –2 to Strength and [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-). Eliminating the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue.

_Run_: A character can’t run for an extended period of time. Attempts to run and rest in cycles effectively work out to a hustle.

_Terrain_: The terrain through which a character travels affects the distance he can cover in an hour or a day (see **[Table: Terrain and Overland Movement](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/exploration-movement/#TOC-Table-Terrain-and-Overland-Movement)**). A highway is a straight, major, paved road. A road is typically a dirt track. A trail is like a road, except that it allows only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with vehicles. Trackless terrain is a wild area with no paths.

##### _Forced March_: 
In a day of normal walking, a character walks for 8 hours. The rest of the daylight time is spent making and breaking camp, resting, and eating.

A character can walk for more than 8 hours in a day by making a forced march. For each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, a Constitution check (DC 10, +2 per extra hour) is required. If the check fails, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from a forced march becomes fatigued. Eliminating the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue. It’s possible for a character to march into unconsciousness by pushing himself too hard.


##### **_Mounted Movement_:** 
A mount bearing a rider can move at a hustle. The damage it takes when doing so, however, is lethal damage, not nonlethal damage. The creature can also be ridden in a forced march, but its [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) checks automatically fail, and the damage it takes is lethal damage. Mounts also become fatigued when they take any damage from hustling or forced marches.
