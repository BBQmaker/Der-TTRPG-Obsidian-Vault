#### DESCRIPTION
You grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to answer questions. You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you in life.

If the dead creature’s alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save to resist the spell as if it were alive. If successful, the corpse can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you, using [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff). The soul can only speak about what it knew in life. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after its death.

If the corpse has been subject to _speak with dead_ within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creature.
