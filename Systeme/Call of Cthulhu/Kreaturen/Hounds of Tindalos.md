### Hounds of Tindalos
They inhabit and move through the angles of time and space, able to materialize through physical angles, although curves are unfriendly to their kind. They assume differing forms, although most are comprised of many angles compressed into something akin to a Cubist nightmare and resembling a great hound or lizard dripping with a viscous blue fluid, with a maw filled with serrated teeth or reaching tongues. Their very visage seems to twist and distort, ever-changing and apparently at odds with this dimension.

Alternative names: the Feasters, Hunting Beasts, Tindalosians, Unstoppable Ones.

The [[Hounds of Tindalos]] inhabit the angles of time, while other beings (such as humanity and all common life) descend from curves. This concept is hard to imagine and only seems to be used with respect to them and the other even more horrible denizens of Tindalos. The hounds prowl the corridors of time, seeking those who would cross the angles to other worlds and times, hunting them down to devour them in a malicious frenzy. Able to follow their prey through time and space, they are immortal and relentless hunters.
Just what these entities look like is uncertain, since those who meet them seem not to survive. Tindalosians exist across hyper-dimensional realms; humans can see only segments or elements of their whole, so, to the naked eye, they appear to shift and change. A hound of Tindalos is hardly likely to look like a hound dog, suggesting that its given name applies more to its hunting nature than specifically to its appearance.
Because of their relationship with the angles of time, they can materialize through any “sharp” corner (120 degrees or less)—the rooms of most human houses have walls that meet at 90 degrees. When a hound manifests, it first appears as black smoke pouring from the corner, from which the head and then the thing’s body emerges.

Eternal Hunters: once a human (usually an unwitting time traveler) has become known to one of these creatures, it will follow through space and time. The hunt may be a matter of days to many years (especially if the prey is able to use technology or magic to jump between worlds, dimensions, or time).

Tindalosian Powers: all entities from Tindalos may possess certain powers, which the Keeper should determine for each specimen encountered—see Tindalosian Powers box, nearby.

Combat
Attacks per round: 1 (claw, bite, tongue)
May use its paws, bite, or tongue to attack.

### Blue Ichor
A hound of Tindalos is covered with a bluish
pus. When a victim is struck by a Fighting attack, a gout of
this mucoid stuff is smeared over them. This pus-like stuff
is alive and active, dealing 2D6 damage to the opponent,
plus equal damage for every round thereafter where the
ichor remains on the victim’s body. The ichor can be wiped
off with a rag or towel with a successful DEX roll (during
combat). It can also be rinsed off with water or some other
agent. Fire would kill the ichor, though the victim also
suffers 1D6 damage to burns.

### Tongue
with a successful tongue attack, a deep penetrating
(though bloodless and painless) hole-shaped wound is
formed. The victim takes no physical damage, despite the
peculiar wound, but loses 3D6 points of POW permanently.
