### Tindalosian Hybrids

Experimentation with the blue substance left by the visitor has proven fruitful. I administered it unbeknown to Wilson to see the effects upon living human tissue. Initially, he succumbed to a fever and I feared the blue substance was nothing more than an exotic poison. Yet, within 48 hours the fever had passed and I began to note physical changes. Soon, his face decayed and fell inward, resulting in the formation of wide and gaping maw equipped with crystalline fangs and a long blue-colored tongue. It is hard to define the final bodily shape of the transformation. It would appear that Wilson’s physicality now resides partially in another dimension, as his form constantly changes and reshapes, with angular sections winking in and out of perception.

Alternative names: Diamond Ones, Glowing Ones, Many- Angled Ones, Visitors.

### Erscheinungsbild
Tindalosian hybrids are not a naturally-occurring species and originate from magic, science, or accident. Humans who ingest the blue ichor that coats both the hounds and lords of Tindalos may become infected, with the substance provoking a dramatic transformation and turning such unfortunates into Tindalosian hybrids. Like anything else tainted or from Tindalos, the physical appearance of a hybrid is strange to human eyes, as their form constantly ripples and shifts, with elements phasing and out of our reality. While roughly humanoid in shape, hybrids have been known to hide their appearance beneath heavy coats, hats, and robes, and tend to avoid daylight, preferring to keep to the shadows as much as possible. When not bothering to keep a facsimile of human shape, a hybrid’s visible portions change radically: hands appear as conglomerates of triangular crystals reminiscent of wolfish claws, while the face is replaced by what seems to be a wide gaping mouth set with crystalline fangs. Feeding is the key priority for a hybrid, which it must accomplish at least once per 24 hours, with the favored meal being human lifeforce. Hence, these entities live predatory lifestyles, hunting humans to ensure their own continued existence. Should a hybrid be unable to feed for 24 hours, it begins to disintegrate. The process is slow and may be halted if a food source becomes available; however, for every 24 hours passing without food, a hybrid loses 10 points of STR and CON and 1 hit point until it ceases to exist.

#### Powers
Able to utilize the Tindalosian Powers (see box, nearby) with the following adjustments.
• Charnel Odor: all humans within 5 yards/meters must succeed with a CON roll or be incapacitated by vomiting for 1D6 rounds.
• Hyper-Sight: costs of magic points for 1 round; power works within a 5-foot (3 m) area. • Step-Through: costs 4 magic points to employ this power.
• Twist Space: costs 5 magic points per round to employ this power.

### Stats
Tindalosian Hybrids, multidimensional killers
char. roll average
STR (4D6+8)x5 110
CON (4D6+8)x5 110
SIZ (2D6+6)x5 65
DEX (4D6+2)x5 80
INT (4D6+2)x5 80
POW (4D6+4)x5 90
Average Hit Points: 17 Average Damage Bonus (DB): +1D6 Average Build: 2
Average Magic Points: 18 Move: 10 Combat
Attacks per round: 2 (claw, bite) or 1 (tongue lash or bite) My attack twice per round with hands/claws or once with a tongue lash (its blue tongue having a range of 2 yards/ meters) or bite. Hybrids target opponents with the highest POW first.

#### Blue Ichor
beings from Tindalos are covered with a bluish pus. When a victim is struck by a Fighting attack, a gout of this mucoid stuff is smeared over them. This pus-like stuff is alive and active, dealing 2D6 damage to the opponent, plus equal damage for every round thereafter where the ichor remains on the victim’s body. The ichor can be wiped off with a rag or towel with a successful DEX roll (during combat). It can also be rinsed off with water or some other agent. Fire would kill the ichor, though the victim also suffers 1D6 damage to burns. Bite: may swallow whole anything up to SIZ 100. Those swallowed have 1D10+6 rounds to escape before they are disintegrated and die. Breaking free requires the use of spells or an enchanted weapon causing a minimum of 12 damage (cumulative). For each round inside the hybrid, a person suffers 1D4 damage and the loss of 1D10 STR, DEX, CON, and APP points; lost STR, DEX, and CON regenerate at 5 points per day of rest, although APP loss is permanent.

#### Tongue
with a successful tongue attack, a deep penetrating hole-shaped chest wound is formed. The hybrid’s tongue remains attached and begins to drain 1D10 points of POW and 3D10 points of CON per round thereafter; POW loss is permanent, although CON loss is temporary (points are regenerated at the rate of 5 points per week of rest; a blood transfusion immediately returns half of the lost CON points). For every 5 points of POW and CON (combined) consumed, the hybrid gains 1 magic point (up to its normal 2m a l maximum) and recovers 1 hit point (to normal maximum). While feeding, the hybrid’s tongue may be targeted for attack (penalty die) and will be severed if suffering 8 damage (the tongue naturally regenerates 1 hit point per round).

#### Phasing
at a cost of 4 magic points per round, a hybrid can phase into hyper-dimensional space, becoming immune to mundane weapons (magical weapons and spells have full effect). 

Fighting 50% (25/10), damage 1D4+DB, plus blue ichor (see above) 
Bite 50% (25/10), damage 1D4 + 1D10 STR, DEX, CON, APP per round (see above) 
Tongue 60% (30/12), damage 1D10 POW + 3D10 CON drain (see above) Dodge 40% (20/8)

#### Skills
Detect Humans 85%, Jump 70%, Listen 70%, Spot Hidden 75%, Stealth 80%.
Armor: 2-point skin; regenerates 3 hit points per round (death at zero hit points); at zero hit points, a hybrid shatters into crystal fragments. Spells: none.
Sanity Loss: 1D4/1D8 Sanity points to encounter a Tindalosian hybrid.
