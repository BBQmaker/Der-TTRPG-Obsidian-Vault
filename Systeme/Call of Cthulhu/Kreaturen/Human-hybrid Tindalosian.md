### Human-hybrid Tindalosian
While trying to maintain a human form, the hybrid’s image often wavers and ripples. Tindalosians exist across hyper-dimensional realms and appear to shift and change when mere three-dimensional mortals can see only segments of their being. When a hybrid is not keeping human shape, their visible portions change radically: hands appear as a conglomerate of triangular crystals (reminiscent of wolfish claws), the face is replaced by what seems to be a wide gaping mouth, with a set of long crystalline fangs, their shape constantly shifts (as if small parts of
it were popping in and out of existence), and their exposed substance appears as a conglomerate of many angles, with no curves at all. Hybrids can extend a snake-like tongue of bluish color to feed upon victims.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hyper-sight: costing 1 magic point per round, the hybrid may survey an
area of up to double their POW in feet in radius, as if they were in the
fourth dimension (all directions, behind walls, in containers, etc., all at
once). They cannot see into magically protected areas or behind round
or spherical spaces, and hybrids still need to make a Spot Hidden roll
to spot a hiding investigator. This ability also allows them to attempt
Dodge rolls no matter the direction of the attack (even behind their back).
Step-through: costing 4 magic points per use, and as long as sharp
angles are within 10 feet, the hybrid can step through via hyperspace
to another angle within POW in feet of them, effectively teleporting. It
takes one round to open the angle, whence mist begins to trickle forth.
It takes a second round to step out through the exit angle.
Twist space: for one round per 5 magic points sacrificed, the hybrid can
ripple local space-time around it, within a radius of one-fifth POW in
feet. Those outside of this area see everything twisting and elongating
in chaotic directions. Those inside see themselves being twisted and
stretched, are incapacitated for 2D6 rounds, and must make a Sanity roll
(1/1D4 loss). To resist being incapacitated by the twisting and stretching
effects, those inside must make an Extreme CON or Extreme POW
roll. Those outside the radius who are firing ranged weapons into the
area of effect suffer a penalty die to their rolls; those attacking from
within the radius suffer two penalty dice. A character inside or outside the area of effect can negate the ranged attack penalty with either a
successful Cthulhu Mythos, Hard Science (Mathematics or Physics)
roll, as well as the sacrifice of 1 Sanity point—the viewer is able to
comprehend the angles of the distortion. Attacks per round: 2 (claw, bite, or tongue lash)Bite: if winning attack roll is an Extreme success, the hybrid’s mouth
inhumanly extends, able to swallow the victim whole. The victim is
gone. Up to SIZ 150 can be swallowed in this manner.
Tongue lash: the tongue leaves small, painless holes in the victim’s flesh,
surrounded by traces of blue ichor. Once attacked with a successful
attack, the tongue remains attached and sucks 1D10 POW per round
(converting each 5 POW into 1 magic point for the hybrid’s use) and
2D10 CON per round. Note lost POW is permanent, but up to half
of the CON points lost may be restored through blood transfusions,
or natural recovery (at rate of 1D6 CON points per day). The tongue
remains attached until withdrawn by the hybrid, or the victim breaks
away with a STR roll, or the tongue is targeted and cut through (penalty
die for attack roll; tongue has STR 65, 8 hit points, and regenerates 3 hit points per round).
Charnel smell: if in full Tindalosian aspect, all within 20 feet must
make a CON roll or be incapacitated by vomiting for 1D6 rounds.

Armor: 2-point skin. Regenerates 3 hit points per round. Mundane
weapons do minimum damage (minimized before applying armor). By
expending 4 magic points per round, the hybrid can shift its physical
essence further into hyper-dimensional space, becoming completely
immune to mundane weapons. In all cases, magical weapons and spells
have full effect. If the hybrid’s hit points drop to zero, it shatters into
numerous crystal fragments, which mostly dissipate. It is up to the
Keeper whether the Hybrid is truly dead at this point, or whether some
fragments regenerate over a long period of time.Spells: none.
Skills: Jump 70%, Listen 70%, Spot Hidden 75%, Stealth 80%.
Sanity Loss: none in human form; seeing Tindalosian form costs
1D2/1D12 Sanity points.
