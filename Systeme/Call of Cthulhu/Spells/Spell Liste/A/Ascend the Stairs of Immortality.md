By sitting in meditation for 6 hours, while holding a
container within which is the “Elixir of Immortality,” the
caster receives an innate sense of when and where the
Ivory Stair will next appear on Earth. Accessing this gate
or portal is said to lead the searcher to an Elder realm of
existence. What exactly they might find there, and what
kind of reception they can expect is unknown.
The prophetic knowledge is good for up to three
weeks in advance of the appearance of the Ivory Stair.
Transportation to the site and actually seeing the
(normally) invisible Ivory Stair is another matter.
