Attract Fish O
• Cost:  4 magic points

 Cast
ing time: 5 minutes
Summons fish to the caster’s location. The caster must prepare 
bait (mixed with the caster’s blood), which is then thrown 
into the ocean (or open water location) while a chant is sung. 
Within 1 hour 1D100 fish, local to the area, congregate. 
Deeper magic: a variation of this spell is known by the deep 
ones, who may impart it to those worthy of their attention. 
The variation does not require blood-bait, but rather a 
talisman, crafted by the deep ones, which is thrown into 
the ocean as a chant to Dagon is sung. Some say the talisman 
doesn’t only attract fish, but also other less wholesome things.
Alternative names: Gather the Abundance of the Sea.
