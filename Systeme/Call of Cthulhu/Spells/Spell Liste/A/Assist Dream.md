This spell can be cast only in the Waking World by 
an experienced dreamer upon going to sleep. The spell 
catapults the dreamer directly into the realm of dream. On 
arrival, the dreamer finds themselves in the dread Vale of 
Pnath—a region strewn with countless bones and inhabited 
by ghouls and the strange and terrible dholes.
Deeper magic: variations of this spell are believed to exist, 
each allowing the caster to journey directly to specific 
Dreamlands location. 
Alternative names: Visitation of Dreams, Beckoning of 
Pnath, Recitation of Sleep.
