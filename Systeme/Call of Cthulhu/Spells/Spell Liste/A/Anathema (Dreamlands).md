 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Taking 
only an instant to speak, the caster says a Word of Power 
that takes form in burning letters before their face and 
which can dispel certain magic spells. All spells within 
earshot that are being maintained by an expenditure of 
magic points are instantly dispelled. In addition, beings 
that have been brought by means of a Call or Summon 
spell must make an opposed POW roll versus the caster 
or be forced back from whence they came. 
Alternative names: Censure, Tongue of Dismissal.
