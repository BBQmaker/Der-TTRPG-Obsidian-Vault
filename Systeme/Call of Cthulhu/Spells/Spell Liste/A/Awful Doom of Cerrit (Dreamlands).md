• Cost:  9+ magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This spell may only successfully be cast in the Dreamlands. 
The spell costs 9 magic points per round that it is maintained 
and has a range of up to 20 yards. A glistening silvery thread 
springs from the caster’s fingertip towards the intended 
target, who suffers from having molten lead run through 
the marrow of his or her bones. Each round the spell is 
maintained, the target is absolutely incapable of any action 
save writhing and screaming. Each round, the spell causes 
the target’s CON to be reduced by 3D10 points permanently.
