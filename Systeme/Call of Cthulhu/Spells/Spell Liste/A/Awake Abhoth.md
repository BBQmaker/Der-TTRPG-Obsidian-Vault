Awake Abhoth 9

 Cast
ing time: 36 hours
This spell is very limited in its application. Previous attempts
to bring the Great Old One, Abhoth, into our plane of
existence have often failed. In some attempts, manifestations
of Abhoth have been split between this world and its dark
dwelling place. In these instances, the partially manifested
Abhoth does not possess any consciousness and is effectively
comatose in our world. This spell awakens the sleeping god
with the promise of beginning the great feast for which it
waits and hungers. The spell takes the form of three rituals
that prove the caster’s faithfulness to Abhoth, with each part
requiring a greater and more personal sacrifice on the part
of the petitioner. At the summation of the rituals, the spell
costs are taken. Whether Abhoth deigns to wake, and for
how long, is uncertain.
