Accursed Eye
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: 30 minutes
This spell can be used to see out of another’s eye socket. 
The target’s eye must first be removed in a ritualistic 
fashion, and a small piece of unwholesome flesh 
(gouged from the caster or another sacrificial victim) is 
placed in the empty socket; the victim, if aware, should 
make a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss). The unwholesome 
flesh immediately binds with that of the victim. Over 
the next 1D10 hours a new eye grows. The victim is 
wracked with headaches during this period.
Once complete, the caster can meditate, allowing him 
or her to see out of the victim’s new eye. It is possible 
for the victim to be unaware of the magic upon them 
(i.e. they do not remember the ritual due to insanity, 
or they were unconscious). Eventually, after 1D6+1 
days, the new eye explodes, causing 1D8+2 damage to 
the victim. A ritual may reverse the original spell (see 
Cleansing Ritual, page 66), or the eye may be forcibly 
removed—causing 1D6+2 damage, plus a Sanity roll 
(0/1D4+1 loss).
Alternative names:  The Devil’s Eye, Sight of the Spectre, 
Eibon’s Gaze.

Activation
• Cost : variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1+ minutes
This spell requires a specifically attuned crystal to cast 
(see Attune Crystal, page 30). If targeting the spell on 
him or herself, the caster holds the enchanted crystal and 
concentrates for a number of minutes equal to the number 
of magic points expended. Each magic point expended 
in the casting provides a +5% chance of success. If cast 
upon another, the target must be in close proximity to the 
attuned crystal, and the caster must be within 10 feet; if 
cast successfully, the caster must overcome the target in 
an opposed POW roll. 
Once cast successfully, the caster is able to activate any 
hidden mi-go modifications in the target’s mind (such as 
those implanted with or without the target’s awareness 
or permission). Unfortunately, the spell is not terribly 
precise and can cause serious side effects—roll 1D8 on 
the following table to determine: Activation C B
