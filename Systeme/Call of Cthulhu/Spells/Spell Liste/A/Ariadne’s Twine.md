Ariadne’s Twine O
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day
When cast on a target (who may also be the caster), their 
mind is filled with a three dimensional map of any maze 
or labyrinth that they physically enter, for the duration of 
the spell (normally from sunrise to midnight following the 
24 hour casting period). As long as this spell is active, the 
target cannot get lost. The sudden flashes of inspiration 
and the experience of realizing the maze in the mind’s eye 
causes the loss of 1D4 Sanity points. An unwilling target 
may counter the spell with an opposed POW roll. 
Where the wizard casts the spell on him or herself, 1D4 
Sanity points are lost for the casting and another 1D4 
points when the maze imposes itself on their mind. On 
subsequent castings, the wizard is better prepared, only 
suffering the Sanity loss from casting the spell.
