Attune Crystal M
• Cost:  5+ POW; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ hour
Allows the caster to attune a crystal for use in the Activation spell (see page 26). The crystal to be used 
must be of high quality, with no imperfections. Every 5 
points of POW invested into the crystal grants +10% to 
the chance of success when casting the Activation spell 
(POW loss is permanent). Casting the spell requires one 
hour of concentration per 5 points of POW expended. The 
crystal remains attuned as long as the caster remains alive. 
It is unknown if such an attuned crystal provides further benefits to the casting of similar magic.
Deeper magic: if mi-go crystal is used, rather than that 
found on Earth, every 5 points of POW expended yields 
a +20% chance of success to the casting of the Activation 
spell.
Alternative names: Empower Crystal, Mental  
Acclimatization of the Stone.
