Animate Flesh Thing 7
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 minutes
Used to animate dead skin and flesh, causing the resultant 
fleshy mass to become sentient and able to attack as the 
caster desires. As the words are spoken, the caster points 
at the carcass (or lumps of flesh gathered for the purpose) 
and the flesh melts from any bones, as do any organs, 
transforming into a thick, fleshy semi-liquid, which can 
move to capture or attack at the caster’s direction. The 
caster invests 1 magic point per 5 SIZ points animated.
The flesh thing continues to live for 24 hours unless 
killed (see following), whereupon it seems to melt again 
into to a pool of smoking and stinking flesh. Within 
minutes the flesh has dissolved, leaving a nasty-smelling 
oily smear on the ground.
Deeper magic: flesh things usually have uniform statistics 
and capabilities, though greater expenditure of magic 
points (5 per 5 SIZ points) can increase the potency, as 
well as the abilities, of the created creature (the Keeper 
should increase characteristics and Sanity loss for such 
mammoth beasts).
Alternative names: Ye Lively Meat, Gathering of the Boiling 
Brawn.
