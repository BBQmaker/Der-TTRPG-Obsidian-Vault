Apportion Ka
• Cost: 10 magic points; 5 POW; 2D10 Sanity points 
(per organ)
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day per organ
A portion of the caster’s life essence, or “Ka,” is transferred 
into one of his or her vital organs. The enchanted organ 
is then removed from the caster’s body, to be hidden away 
for safekeeping and providing the wizard with a form of 
invulnerability—as long as the enchanted organ remains 
safely hidden the wizard will not suffer particular attacks 
and may even be invulnerable to death.
This spell was first used by followers of the Dark 
Pharaoh, who would remove a vital organ, such as the 
heart or liver, and lock them away in safe places. This 
would make the caster virtually impossible to kill, if not for the spell’s one weakness. The brain is the seat of the 
spell’s power and, as such, could not be removed. If the 
brain was destroyed, the other organs would lose their 
magical properties and the caster would die. Having one’s 
own insides removed costs 2D10 Sanity points and the 
permanent loss of 5 POW per organ removed. 
Attacks that impale cause only normal damage (unless 
the head is specifically targeted). Invulnerability stems 
from which organ is removed; for example if the lungs are 
removed then the caster is unaffected by lack of oxygen 
(thus drowning and suffocation are no longer threats). 
Removal of vital organs may also render the caster immune 
to poison and so forth.
If the caster is harmed, hit points should be reduced as 
usual, leading to unconsciousness but not death. Death 
will only occur if the brain is specifically targeted and 
destroyed.

The Deathless Breath.
