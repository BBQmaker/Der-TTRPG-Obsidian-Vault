Awaken the Beast (Folk) 0
• Cost: 5 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1D3 hours
Transforms a human over a period of 1D6+2 days into an 
animal, permanently. The spell requires a number of hours 
to cast, involving chanting and painting the target’s body to 
represent the animal they are to become; thus, requiring a 
successful Art/Craft (Painting) skill roll for the spell to be 
successful. The transformation is usually into a mammal, 
although occasionally it can be a reptile. Each variation of 
this spell tends to be specific to the region in which it is 
used, so if cast by an African sorcerer, the form would be 
of an animal native to the African continent, and so forth. 
May only be cast at night during a full moon. The target 
does not have to be willing or aware of the effects of the 
spell, but they must eat—willingly or not—a pound of 
human flesh for the spell to work. For the transformation 
to be successful the caster must make an opposed POW 
roll versus the target. The target loses 1D4 Sanity points 
for their participation in the ceremony. 
During the transformation, the target starts to take on 
characteristics of the animal they are about to become, 
such as fur, scales, elongated snouts, canines, paws, and so 
on, generally loosing INT while their other characteristics 
increase or decrease over the period of transformation—
see the Beasts section in the Call of Cthulhu Rulebook for 
statistics of various animals. Once the target becomes aware 
of the transformation, they lose a further 1D3/1D10 Sanity 
points per day until either their intelligence becomes too 
far diminished (INT less than 35) or they go permanently 
insane. People who are willing participants in the ceremony 
and who make a successful Hard POW roll, can choose to 
retain their INT and their ability to speak as humans, even 
though the rest of their body become animal. Regardless, 
Sanity loss continues until the target becomes permanently 
insane or simply becomes “animal” due to loss of INT (and 
thereby loses any speech ability). There is no known cure or reversal for this transformation.
