ing time: 3+ minutes
Moderates or exacerbates weather conditions. Large groups 
may cast the spell to achieve greater meteorological effects. 
The Keeper establishes the base conditions. Every 10 
magic points sacrificed effects one level of change (see 
table following). The caster may expend as many magic 
points as they are able, as can any participant who knows 
the spell. Those ignorant of the spell may contribute 1 
magic point only. 
Casting the spell costs every participant 1 Sanity point, 
and requires a song-like chant to be uttered for three 
minutes per level of weather change. The effective radius 
of the base spell is two miles; this area can be widened at 
a cost of +10 magic points for each additional mile. The 
change in the weather lasts 30 minutes for every 10 magic 
points of the total contributed, but violent weather, such 
as a tornado, lasts a much shorter time.
Five weather components can be changed, in varying 
levels of effect. One level costs 10 magic points to change, 
thus to change the two levels from “partly cloudy” to “heavy clouds” takes 20 magic points. For snow to fall 
the temperature must be 30 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, otherwise the precipitation is rain, not snow. 
Alternative names:  Master the Elements, Rain Dance, 
Gatherer of Storms.
