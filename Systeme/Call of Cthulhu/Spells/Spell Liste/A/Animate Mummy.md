Animate Mummy 7

 Cast
ing time: 1+ hour
A ritual used to animate an undead mummy as described in 
the Call of Cthulhu Rulebook . The mummy has double the 
STR it had in life, half again its original CON, and two-
thirds of its DEX; its movement rate is 6. Mummies retain 
all knowledge of skills and spells from their former lives. 
As the mummy’s brain is removed during the preparation 
process—for purposes of the game—this has no effect on 
INT; it is assumed that the spirit essence trapped in the 
body retains such information.
Deeper magic:  with a ritual process of 40 days, the caster 
may perform a full mummification, turning a deceased 
human into a mummy, and then bringing them to life. 
The process follows the classical procedure for removal of 
organs, embalming, and wrapping of the corpse.Alternative names: Ritual of Mumia.
