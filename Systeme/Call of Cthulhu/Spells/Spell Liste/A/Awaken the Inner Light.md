Awaken the Inner Light
• Cost: 1 magic point
• Casting time: 1 month
A ritual allowing the caster to slowly augment their POW,
increasing magical potential and potency through gradual
enlightenment. Requires a strict regimen of diet, fasting,
meditation, and exercises, the spell requires the caster
to spend at least two hours a day in meditation inside a
magical circle. The circle requires 1 magic point to activate.
The practice of daily rituals and meditation must be strictly
observed for an entire month as the slightest deviation
breaks the spell. At the end of one lunar month, the caster
attempts an Extreme POW roll (cannot be modified by
the use of pre-enchanted circles or other magical tools).
If successful, the caster’s POW increases by 5 points.
This POW increase causes a corresponding increase of
magic points, and the caster gains 5 Sanity points (if not
already insane) but, in addition, the caster ages 5 years
(with resultant changes to characteristics as applicable).
If the roll fails, or if the ritual is in any way interrupted,
the caster gains no benefits, but neither do they age—they
must wait a full lunar month before attempting it again.
Alternative names: Diet of Cleansing and Energy,
Meditation of Yha-P’Tan.
