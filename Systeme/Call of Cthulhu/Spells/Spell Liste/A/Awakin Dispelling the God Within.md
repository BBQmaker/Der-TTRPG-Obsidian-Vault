Awaking/Dispelling the God Within 7
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Allows a star-seed to be implanted within a creature 
capable of conscious thought. The ritual must be performed 
no more than one month before the return of the Sirius 
to the night sky in midsummer, after being hidden by 
the sun’s light for seventy days. The ritual takes an hour, 
and the seed must enter the body with the milk of Shub-
Niggurath. The presence of Nyarlathotep is also required. 
For every magic point spent by the caster, there is a 
5% chance the implant will be successful. A successful 
Art/Craft (Music) roll allows the caster to synchronize a 
rhythm between the blood of the target and the celestial 
Music of the Spheres, increasing the chance of success 
by another 10%. A roll of 96–100 is always a failure. The 
caster will be unaware if the implantation was successful. This ritual cannot be performed on oneself. 
See nearby box, Star-Seeds, page 34.Dismissal/Reversal Spell:
The reversal ritual (a separate component to the spell, 
which does not require knowledge of the full spell) requires 
a successful Hard INT roll to learn. Having learned the 
reversal, it can then be taught to others, even those who do 
not fully comprehend the formula. After a couple of hours of 
instruction, a student who succeeds a Hard INT roll has also 
learned the reversal spell. The reversal involves the chanting 
of the formula for an hour; the recipient hears a rhythm pulse 
from within, becoming louder and louder. Soon, the target 
hears a rhythm from far away realizes that this music comes 
from the heavens itself and makes a Sanity roll (0/1D3 loss). 
The target may attempt an Art/Craft (Music) roll to create 
a counter rhythm to assist the reversal spell.
For every magic point spent, there is a cumulative 
5% chance that the caster will purge the seed from the Opposite: Mythos Notes by Goomi
