Casting grants portents of the future—if the caster is 
enlightened enough to understand them. The tools for 
scrying vary and could be anything from using a scrying 
mirror to tarot cards, animal entrails to tealeaves, the 
casting of runes or watching the flight patterns of birds. 
Timing can vary due to the tools and nature of the scrying.
The chance of understanding an augury is a roll equal 
to or less than the augur’s POW. A portent may be vague, 
subtle, dreamlike, or in a cryptic verse—the future is not a 
book to be read, but rather a message or impression upon 
the caster’s mind. Successful use of the spell should provide 
at least one useful piece of information.
Note: the Keeper should prepare the portent with care. 
Revealing too much can easily rob players of their sense 
of free will and can limit the Keeper’s freedom of action. 
Revealing too little is pointless and frustrating. A well-
balanced portent can add meaningful thrills and chills to 
the game when the Keeper stages future events which seem 
to correlate with the portent.
Alternative names: Augur, Scry, Cast the Runes, The Eye 
of Destiny.
