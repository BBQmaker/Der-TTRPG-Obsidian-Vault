### Create Amulet
• Cost: 10 magic points; 10 POW; 1 Sanity point
• Casting time: 1 week

The sorcerer crafts an amulet from a semi-precious gemstone—each type of gemstone has its own unique property that influences the amulet’s specific powers, which are amplified by images carved onto its surface by the sorcerer. After creating the amulet, the person whol will wear the amulet must sacrifice something personal to them. When the enchanted amulet is worn about the neck as a pendant or carried, it can be used to summon the aid of a “supernatural guardian” once per 24 hours. This non-corporeal entity (the nature of which is left to the Keeper to determine) may provide one of the following services (once per 24 hours):

• Heal 5 points of damage.
• Increase the wearer’s POW by 10 points for one hour.
• Increase the wearer’s STR by 10 points for one hour.
• Increase the wearer’s CON by 10 points for one hour.
• Increase the wear’s DEX by 10 points for one hour.

The amulet loses its power if it becomes defaced or broken. How long the entity continues to grant boons to the holder is a source of much conjecture among wizards, as some tell of entities growing tiresome and angry at this constant drain upon their energies, causing them to twist the benefit into a curse, or to seek other ways to become free of the amulet’s call upon them.
