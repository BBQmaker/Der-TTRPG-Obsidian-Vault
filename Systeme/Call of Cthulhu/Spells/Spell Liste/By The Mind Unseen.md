Certain ascetics, after years of intense study, manage to
master this spell, which effectively grants them invisibility.

Whilst not actually imparting true invisibility, it causes those around the caster to take no notice of his presence or even recall that he was ever there unless the caster deliberately does something to an observer (such as attack him).

Cost: equal to his SIZ/5 magic point; 1 Sanity point
â€¢ Casting time: instantaneous

The caster sacrifices Magic Points equal to his SIZ, plus one additional Magic Point for each round he wishes the spell to remain in force. If he interacts directly with another person or creature, the spell is broken.
