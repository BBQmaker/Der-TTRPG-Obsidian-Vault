Destroy Spawn of Yig 6
• Cost:  2 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The caster recites a song that destroys an un-hatched or 
recently hatched spawn of Yig. The egg the spawn must 
have been exposed to sunlight before the spell is sung. It 
takes one round to sing the spell and a successful Art/Craft 
(Singing) roll is required for the spell to be effective: if 
successful, all un-hatched or recently born spawn within 
10 feet of the caster wither and die.
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Deeper magic: records of some sorcerers recount that 
despite this spell being successful, the caster is somehow 
cursed by Yig in revenge for destroying the Great Old 
One’s young. The form of this curse may be mild or strong, 
depending on the size of affront afforded to Yig: from 
an indelible mark of a serpent appearing on the caster’s 
body to the caster’s tongue metamorphosing into that of 
a snake’s. Whether there is truth to any of these tales is 
left to the Keeper to decide.
Alternative names:  Damnation of the Serpent Lord, 
Withering of the Cursed Young.
