Drown Mind 6
• Cost:  4 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The target of the spell falls unconscious for 1D20 × 10 
minutes. Additional people can be targeted at the cost of 
an additional 4 magic points each. The caster needs to win 
an opposed POW roll against their target. Note that the 
caster may pay double the magic point cost to gain a bonus 
die to the opposed POW roll. Victims of the spell awake 
suffering nausea, temporarily suffering a penalty die to all 
physically related skills for 1D4 × 15 minutes. If a target 
successfully resists, they remain conscious but feel as if they 
are falling into a bottomless well; they are still afflicted with 
nausea (and the associated penalty die) for 15 minutes.
Alternative names: Cascades of Nerves, Mind Gouge.
