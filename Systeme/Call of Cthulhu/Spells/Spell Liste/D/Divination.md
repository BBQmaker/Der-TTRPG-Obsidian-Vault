ing time: 1 round
The central component to the spell is a bowl of water situated 
in an elevated position, around which are placed mild opiates 
in incense burners. The receptacle is positioned in the center 
of a circle, twenty feet in diameter, marked with salt or chalk, 
inlaid with a pentagram. The caster and four assistants stand 
at the points of the pentagram and chant prayers to Yog-
Sothoth, beseeching the deity for a glimpse of their future. 
The caster and each of the four assistants offer a drop of 
their blood into the bowl, spending 1 magic point and 1D6 
Sanity points each.
Upon successfully casting the spell, all who look into 
the bowl and breathe in the burning opiates may make a 
POW roll: failure means that nothing has happened for the 
viewer, but costs an additional 1D4 magic points; success 
means that the viewer sees an image from their near future 
reflected upon the gleaming surface of the water, and costs 
an additional 1D6 magic points. Any shocking images they 
might see could prompt further Sanity loss.s

The bowl retains its power for 1D4 hours. During this 
time anyone, not just those who helped in the casting, can 
use it to discern a moment of their future. Viewers may 
attempt to see multiple glimpses of the future, making 
the POW roll in each instance, and paying the same costs 
detailed above for each success and failure.
Keeper note: predicting the future in scenarios is troublesome, 
as events in play can often dramatically alter the course of an adventure. As such, choose with great care what visions 
investigators receive with this spell; make them ambiguous and 
fuzzy enough to fit an array of potential circumstances later in play.

Destiny.
