 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The sorcerer draws upon the energies of the Outer God to 
directly drain POW from a target. By repeating the secret 
name of Azathoth, one can generate respect and fear in any 
being conversant with the Mythos, for to know the name 
implies that one knows the secret Last Syllable. Said alone, 
the Last Syllable may be directed against a foe. For the Opposite: Dread Curse of Azathoth by Juan Barba

spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed 
POW roll with the target. If the caster is successful, the 
target loses 3D6 POW.
Deeper magic: truly mighty wizards are able to consume 
the drained POW in order to increase their own POW 
characteristic (and magic points).
