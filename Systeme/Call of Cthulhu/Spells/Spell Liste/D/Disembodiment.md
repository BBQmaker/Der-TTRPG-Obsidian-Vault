ing time: 10 minutes
Frees the target’s soul of its material envelope. If cast at 
another person the caster must win an opposed POW roll: 
if the caster is successful, the target makes an immediate Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss). While disembodied, the target’s 
body remains unconscious and the spirit and body maintain 
a magical connection (commonly imagined as a silvery 
filament) over any distance. The spirit will know if its 
body suffers damage and the body reacts if the spirit loses 
magic points or POW. If the spirit is destroyed, the body also dies.A disembodied spirit can sense the mundane world as if 
viewed through a mist or gauze, can sense other spirits—
embodied or not—and can initiate spirit combat with 
either an embodied or disembodied spirit. The spell also 
allows the caster to sense if two or more spirits inhabit 
the same body and the caster may choose which spirit is 
targeted. If the spirit resists, spirit combat may be initiated: 
if the caster wins such a combat, the spirit can be driven 
out of the body. The caster runs the risk of the hostile 
spirit possessing them if they should lose the spirit combat.
The disembodied spirit may cast spells but can’t 
otherwise physically interact with the mundane world.
