## Become Spectral
• Cost: 1 magic point per round of duration; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1 round

Hides the caster from mundane observers by shifting his or her body into a parallel dimension, termed by sorcerers as “Limbo”. The caster and their personal possessions become invisible to all but spirit senses. Sight and hearing remain attuned to the material plane but with a distant, less distinct character, as if a cold mist surrounds them.
The caster can move normally. The spell’s effect lasts for 1 round per magic point invested. Becoming spectral carries an inherent danger: extradimensional creatures can sense the presence of a spectral body and engage in spirit or magical attack. Generally, failing a Luck roll, the spectral character may come to attention of a spirit who may elect to observe, pursue, or attack; such spirits typically have POW equal to (2D6+4×5)”. Of course, opportunities to present more powerful and cunning opponents are possible.
