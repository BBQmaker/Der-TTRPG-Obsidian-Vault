BINDING SPELLS
• Cost:  1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Binding and Summoning are two sides of the same coin. 
Sometimes they are learned as one spell, sometimes not. 
At the Keeper’s discretion the effects may be combined 
into a single spell, or two separate spells might be asked 
for, one to summon and a second to bind.
If a monster arrives unbound or is come upon 
unexpectedly, it may be bound on the spot. The caster 
must know the correct Binding spell and must spend a 
round chanting before the thing can be bound. For the 
spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed 
POW roll with the target. Each attempted binding costs 
1 Sanity point but usually no magic points. A binding 
works on only one creature at a time. One option open 
to the caster is to invest a number of magic points equal 
to one-fifth of the summoned creature’s POW to gain a 
bonus die on the opposed POW roll to bind the monster s

(a successful Cthulhu Mythos roll may be required for 
the caster to ascertain the creature’s magnitude of Power). 
Others may assist the person attempting the binding by 
sacrificing magic points in support.
An attacking creature cannot be bound by the person 
it is fighting; however, it could be bound by a person able 
to stand back from the fray. A creature to be bound must 
(normally) be visible to the caster and within 100 yards. Binding requires an opposed roll and opposed rolls cannot 
be pushed; if the opposed roll is failed, the caster is in 
trouble!
Gaining control of a creature bound by another 
spellcaster is risky and requires the current binding to be 
broken before a new binding can be attempted. To break 
the binding performed by another sorcerer, an opposed 
POW roll is attempted (versus the POW of the original

binder). If successful, the original binding is broken and 
the creature is free and a new binding must be performed 
quickly lest the creature depart or seek to vent its anger 
and frustration on those nearby. 
Note: see Summoning Spells (page 174).
Form of the Command 
The caster’s command to the summoned thing must be 
specific and limited in duration: “protect me from harm 
forever,” would not be a valid command; however, “slay 
that man in the corner,” would be. The thing is bound 
to the caster until it fulfills a command (a bound thing 
without a command soon finds a way to leave). Orders 
might include carrying someone somewhere, presiding 
at some ceremony, being especially docile while being 
examined by a group of professors, appearing somewhere as 
a warning to those assembled—whatever can be imagined. 
Keep commands simple. The best rule of thumb is that 
a command should have no more words than one-fifth 
of the thing’s INT. Simple gestures such as pointing will 
be understood. Assume that the thing is always able to 
understand a straightforward command, whether spoken 
in English, Urdu, or whatever language. 
By way of example, see page 42 for a range of specific 
binding spells.
