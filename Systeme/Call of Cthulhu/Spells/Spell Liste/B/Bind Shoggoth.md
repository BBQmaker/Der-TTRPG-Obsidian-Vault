Bind Shoggoth 8
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Binds a single shoggoth to the command of the caster 
for as long as the caster has enough magic points. The 
shoggoth must be visible to the caster. The caster must 
succeed in an opposed POW roll against the shoggoth 
while enunciating a complex series of sounds (requiring a 
successful Hard Know roll the first time this spell is cast to 
ensure the correct vocalizations are made—thereafter, the 
Keeper may waive this requirement). The binding remains 
for 5 rounds per 5 magic points invested by the caster. The 
spell can be prolonged with the expenditure of further 
magic points, although a new opposed POW roll is also 
required (shoggoths being resentful ornery sorts, they will 
seek to resist the binding). 
Deeper magic: may be cast in multiple, with the cost 
multiplied by the number of shoggoths, allowing more 
than one shoggoth to be affected. Greater Mythos insight 
allows the caster to sacrifice 10 POW to bind a shoggoth 
for a period of 5 days (along with an opposed POW roll) 
and may be prolonged with further expenditure of POW.
