 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. It infests a 
target with dreadful diseases. The target must be touched 
by the caster, with an opposed POW roll determining the 
spell’s success. A piece of fresh human flesh is required 
as a material component (the caster touches the target 
with the flesh).
The first symptoms manifest in 1D10 rounds. While 
the symptoms of individual illnesses vary, mechanically, 
victims of the spell always lose 2D10 CON points daily 
until they are cured or die. In addition, they also suffer a 
penalty die to all skill rolls while suffering from the disease. 
There is a 10% chance (per day) that anyone coming into s

contact with an infected dreamer will also contract the 
illness. Counter magic, or a successful Hard Medicine roll 
cures the diseased dreamer and allows lost CON points to 
regenerate in 2D6 hours.
Should an infected dreamer wake up before perishing 
(thus, leaving the Dreamlands), he or she is saved. On the 
next visit to the Dreamlands no sign of the sickness exists.

Touch.
