Breath of Pazzuzu 6
• Cost:  3 magic points; 3 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
The caster spews forth a visible cloud of noxious vapors 
from their mouth, like a jet of steam. The foul breath affects 
one target up to a distance 30 yards. The target loses 1D6 
hit points from this choking poison. The noxious vapor 
dissipates immediately in the open air (active for just one 
round), but stays active in an enclosed space until a window 
is opened or a draft is otherwise created (see following).
If the target is aware of the stream of noxious vapor 
(possibly a Spot Hidden or Listen roll), he or she may 
attempt to Dodge its effects (in the first round). Those 
unable to Dodge lose 1D8 hit points. On the second round 
1D6 hit points are lost, followed by 1D4 hit points on 
the fourth round, and 1D2 hit points in the final round. 
Damage is negated if the target manages to escape the 
vicinity of the vapor. Anyone else in the area suffers 1D4 
damage per round for 4 rounds.
Alternative names: The Stinking Breath of Seven Hells, 
Corpse Air.
