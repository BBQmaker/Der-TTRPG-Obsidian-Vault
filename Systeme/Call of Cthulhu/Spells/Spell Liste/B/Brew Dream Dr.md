Brew Dream Drug
• Cost: 4 magic points (plus 1 per extra draught); 2 Sanity 
points to brew
•
 Cast
ing time: 5+ hours
Fashions a drug that facilitates entry into a world of dream 
for one or more participants. Those drinking a draught fall 
asleep very quickly, for around four hours. The subjective 
length of the dream may be long or short (normally days or 
even years) and memories of the dream may be distorted. 
All who drink of the same drug find themselves together in 
the dream. By the origin and proportion of the ingredients 
the caster may guide dream entry into a specific area 
correlative to the Waking World, such as a specific city or 
to some special place or other dimension. The location may 
include the Dreamlands, or specific isolated dream realities.
Casting the spell and mixing the drug takes about five 
hours. While most of the ingredients are reasonably easy 
to obtain (herbs), others may present a challenge (at the 
Keeper’s discretion). Differing versions of the recipe exist but 
one ingredient common to all is 1 ounce of gold. The result 
is a sweet, thin brown liquid. A mild narcotic effect relaxes 
the drinker and inclines him or her toward dreams. After the 
first, each additional draught made at the same time costs one 
additional magic point—to make five draughts, for instance, 
would cost a total of 8 magic points and 2 Sanity points.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, 
Occult, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure 
that brewing directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names: Kuranes’ Brew, Draft of the Sleepless, 
Gateway to the Golden Meadows.
