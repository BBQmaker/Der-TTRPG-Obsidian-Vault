Bind Soul C
• Cost:  10 magic points;  5 POW; 3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3+ days 
Allows the caster to imprison a human soul and thereby 
control or murder the body from which the soul came. The 
caster must be able to find the soul before it can be imprisoned.
For the spell to take effect an opposed POW roll must 
be made between the caster and target. Alternatively, the 
caster and target may engage in spirit combat: the caster 
must drive the target’s spirit to zero magic points and 
then cast Bind Soul. Either way, if the soul is trapped, 
the target’s body begins to die, at the rate of 10 CON per 
day. When CON reaches zero the body dies. This spell is 
often used in conjunction with Compel Flesh ( page 69).
A special vessel for the soul must have been prepared (a 
ritual taking three days). Anything that can be closed (a 
jar, a box, a bottle, etc.) will do as a vessel. If the vessel can 
be found, the soul can be released by opening or breaking 
the vessel (it can then do as it will).
The Powder of Ibn-Ghazi (page 151) and similar magic 
can trace the link between body and soul. The location 
of the vessel can be calculated by triangulation or by 
expending a considerable amount of powder and simply 
following the spider-web-like link left tangible by the 
powder.
