Bespeak the End of the Day e
• Cost: 6 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1 hour
This powerful conjuration calls upon Hastur and utilizes 
the Yellow Sign to grant a vision of a of specific moment 
that will happen in the future. The vision places the caster 
or the spell’s target inside a scene from their near future 
(sight, sound, taste, smell, and texture are all conveyed). 
The viewer is fully aware of what is happening in the scene 
but cannot affect it. A Sanity roll may be required for what 
is seen. “Near future” is an elastic timeframe, determined by 
the Keeper; it is suggested that such foretelling ranges to 
no more than one week, and usually just to 24 to 36 hours.
Until the vision has come to pass, the viewer is marked—
in the interim, others succeeding with a Cthulhu Mythos 
roll, and certain Mythos entities of the Keeper’s choice, 
may see the viewer as somehow “marked” and best left 
alone; no matter what comes to pass, the viewer will at 
some point find themselves in the reality of the future 
scene witnessed.
During the spell, the caster or spell’s target must 
concentrate on a course of action for which they seek a 
resolution: for example, if they are trying to locate a person, 
they may see a scene in which they find that person in a 
certain locale. 
At the Keeper’s discretion, if the spell’s target is 
somehow able to avoid their fated future (as seen in the 
vision) then something very bad will happen to them. As 
they have actively denied their future, cosmic forces will 
align against them; perhaps forcing them to into a deadly 
situation, extracting some form of mocking bad luck, or 
adversely affecting their abilities for a suitable period.Opposite: Bespeak the End of the Day by Juan Barba

Note: the Keeper must be careful as to what to show the 
viewer. The scene merely provides a few second’s glimpse of 
an event but not necessarily its consequences. The Keeper depicts 
the vision and effectively safeguards the viewer to that point 
in time from certain Mythos minions and creatures.
