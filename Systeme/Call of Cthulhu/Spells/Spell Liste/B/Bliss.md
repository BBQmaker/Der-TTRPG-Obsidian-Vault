Bliss 2
• Cost:  3+ magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This spell permits the caster to escape to a mental refuge 
to protect them from what would normally cause Sanity 
loss (seeing a Mythos monster, prolonged torture, etc.). It 
costs 3 magic points for each minute of “bliss” and 1 Sanity 
point per casting. The drawback is that the spell’s target 
(if not the caster) is unable to move or defend themselves 
physically for the duration of the spell. 
Alternative names: Blinded, Suffer Not The Awfulness, 
Mental Resolution.
