This rare spell, known only to certain masters of Buddhism, 
targets an individual who has performed some form of 
action in the past, and have that action be returned upon 
them (effectively, repaying in kind the action of the target 
in a karmic sense). The caster cannot choose the nature of 
the karma to befall the target.
Use of this spell requires knowledge of the basic tenets 
of Buddhism and the spell has a variable cost based upon 
the action of the target (which must be known to the 
caster) and the timeframe in which it took place:
Event Spell Cost
1-12 months 2 magic points per month
1-5 years 5 POW
2-25 years 10 POW
25-125 years 15 POW
125-625 years 20 POW
In addition, the more serious the event wished to be repaid, 
the greater the cost on the mind of the caster:
Event Additional Spell Cost
Ethically 
questionable 
(stealing, lying)4 Sanity points
Serious taboo 
(murder, torture)6 Sanity points
Reprehensible act 
(cannibalism, 
necrophagia)10 Sanity Points
Cosmic 
(involving 
Mythos Gods)20 Sanity Points
Casting the spell requires a POW roll each time it is 
performed, with a fumbled result causing the effects to 
turn on the caster. The karma begins to affect the target 
in 1D4 days. To the target, the effects of the spell manifest 
as natural occurrences or uncanny coincidences. The 
Keeper should determine the effects, which should be 
commensurate with the target’s original action (e.g. if the 
target stole something, the spells causes something to be taken from the target, and so on).
Alternative names: none known.
