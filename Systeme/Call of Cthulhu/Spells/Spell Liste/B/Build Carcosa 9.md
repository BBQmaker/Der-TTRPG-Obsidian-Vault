Build Carcosa 9 b
• Cost:  1D10 Sanity points (1D8 for supporters)
•
 Cast
ing time: 75 minutes
May only be successfully cast at night when Aldebaran is 
visible above the horizon. The casting must be beside a 
body of water (that totals at least one cubic mile in volume) 
and nine other persons must be complicit in the casting. 
The caster reads aloud the spell’s text, while simultaneously 
the others read parts directly from The King in Yellow . As 
the competing readings progress, a mist forms across the 
water and the buildings and squares of Carcosa shimmer into existence around the group.
The spawn of Hastur appear, although the caster and 
supporters are safe from attacks as long as they continue 
their readings (Sanity rolls are appropriate; 1D6/1D20 
loss). Those going insane must succeed with a Hard POW 
roll to continue reading and supporting the spell; those 
failing may be replaced, if more supporters are available, 
but unless someone steps straight into their place, the 
spawn attacks the whole cast indiscriminately. Regardless 
of the spell’s progress, the spawn can attack anyone in the 
forming city who is not part of the “performance”.
Upon completion of the spell, the caster has lost 1D10 
Sanity points, the active supporters 1D8. The spawn 
disappear into the water, which has become dark, almost 
black, while the city on the shore is fully formed and tangible. 
Carcosa on Earth is a simulacrum of its true version in the 
Hyades (perhaps it is even the city transplanted). It remains 
on Earth for one week, if the caster remains alive within 
it. The existence of Carcosa on Earth also allows the spell 
Free Hastur (page 119)  to be more easily cast. If Hastur is 
summoned to the city, he may remain on Earth indefinitely 
(subject to his whim). While they remain in the city, those 
involved in the casting of Build Carcosa do not age: like the 
city itself they remain in stasis. 
Alternative names: none known.
