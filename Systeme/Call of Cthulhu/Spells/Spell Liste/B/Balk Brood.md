Balk Brood 9
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
Calls forth the brood of Eihort from a target. The caster 
(and others who know the spell) can expend as many magic 
points as desired. Those who touch the caster while the spell 
is intoned may add +1 magic point per person, though the 
Sanity cost remains at 1D3 points for each person involved.
The caster multiplies the number of magic points invested 
in the ritual by five and attempts to roll under this number 
on 1D100 in an opposed roll against the Keeper—the Keeper 
multiplies the number of days elapsed since the injection of 
the brood of Eihort by five, and attempts to roll under this 
value in the contest. If the caster is successful, the brood 
infesting the target promptly cascade out of his or her 
STAR-SEEDS
Star-seeds are somehow connected with the Outer Gods. 
When a world is still developing, the star-flung seeds impact 
upon it, where they remain hidden, sending out visions that 
will eventually be received by sufficiently developed life forms. 
The seeds communicate their location and the ceremonies 
required to facilitate their development. With the proper rituals 
and the milk of Shub-Niggurath, a swallowed seed burrows 
into an intelligent creature’s heart. There it nests, absorbing 
nutrients from the body, breaking it down to feed its growth, 
and becoming immaterial. When the Sirius triple-star system 
(only the brightest star of which appears to the human eye) 
appears in the proper conjunction, the change is complete and 
the otherworldly being bursts forth, leaving behind the empty 
skin of the host. It then leaves the planet behind to cavort 
amongst the stars and continue on its next stage of its existence. 
Of course, the process is not always successful. Many times, 
a creature’s body rejects the seed. Sometimes the host is driven 
mad, driving it to suicidal behavior. 

THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
orifices, costing 1D4 Sanity points in the process. The target 
also loses 1 hit point for each day they have been infested 
by the brood. The infestation may already have caused the 
target great harm, which their presence keeps from being 
obvious. Removing the brood may kill the target, but they are 
doomed anyway should the infestation take its natural course.
At each casting of this spell the participants risk the 
appearance of Eihort; beginning at 10%, but rising by +10% 
each time the spell is cast thereafter. Eihort will attack the 
caster first, acting to destroy those who oppose its brood.
