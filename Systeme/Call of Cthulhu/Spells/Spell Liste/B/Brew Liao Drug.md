Brew Liao Drug e
• Cost:  15 magic points to brew
• Casting time: 1 day
Exotic and expensive substances must be mixed together to create one dose of the drug Liao. Once taken, one’s mind begins to wander through time and space. With a successful POW roll, the user can guide their mind in any direction. Each minute after the drug takes hold costs the user 1 magic point. The effects can last as many minutes as the user has magic points (the user may increase the time by “burning” hit points after magic points are depleted). The user perceives their surroundings as getting dark; objects fade out. A feeling of being dissociated, somehow leaving the room, prevails. There is also a profound sense of anticipation. The user begins to see and feel all points
of space-time at once. This sensation can be bewildering,
terrifying, and even mistaken for the onset of madness;
requiring a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss). There is other danger
as well: if the user’s mind wanders too far back or too far
forward in time, he or she begins to perceive the monstrous
machinations of the Mythos, and this may require further
Sanity rolls at the Keeper’s discretion.
If the user goes far, far back in time, angles and curves
manifest, and forms begin to twist and shift, filling the viewer
with dread (1/1D6 Sanity loss). The user becomes aware of an
odor, pungent and indescribable, so nauseating it can barely
be endured. They may encounter the hounds of [[Tindalos]]
at this point—such an encounter is potentially disastrous.
When the user runs out of magic points, they lapse
into unconsciousness. A user can be physically shaken by
a friend, snapping their mind back to the present.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, or
Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure that brewing
directions are carefully followed.
