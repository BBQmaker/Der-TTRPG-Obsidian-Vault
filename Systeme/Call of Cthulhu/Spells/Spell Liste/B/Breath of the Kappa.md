Breath of the Kappa n
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell of Japanese origin relates to the kappa, a race 
of amphibious vampires said to be an offshoot branch of 
deep ones. In the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan, the kappa 
are described as able to bestow their breath, providing the 
recipient with the ability to breathe underwater. This spell 
is said to replicate this effect.
The spell has duration of twelve hours (if the recipient 
is still underwater, they begin to drown), but may be 
prolonged by repaying the spell’s cost. The person gifted 
the ability must make a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss) as they 
become aware that a set of gills has developed on either 
side of their neck. 
The text warns that prolonged use of this gift turns the 
recipient into a kappa. Each time the spell is prolonged or 
used again the recipient must make a CON roll: if failed, the 
spell’s effect become permanent and they are no longer able 
to breathe air (as the gills become permanent), provoking 
further Sanity loss at the direction of the Keeper (suggested 
Sanity drain of 1+ point per day until zero Sanity is reached). 
Other physical changes are also in the hands of the Keeper.
