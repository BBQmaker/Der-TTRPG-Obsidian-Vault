A cornerstone of Egyptian magic, Paut is an inky liquid 
suffused with magical essence. Silver, pure water, and a 
host of rare unguents, herbs, and spices compose the list 
of ingredients. To brew Paut, the caster must prepare a 
bowl or receptacle and ritually mix the ingredients for 
one hour under the light of both the sun and the moon. 
Lengthy chants are involved, and the caster must spend 
5 magic points to finish the spell. Once finished, the s

smixture is left covered until the next full moon, when the 
Paut is congealed and ready to use. Note that the required 
ingredients are rare and expensive. Once brewed, Paut 
keeps indefinitely in any kind of sealed container.
Paut is often mixed with ink or imbibed during Egyptian 
rituals. Its primary benefit is as a magical restorative: 
anyone drinking Paut regains 1 magic point per ounce 
of Paut consumed. Though it tastes vile, it is quite 
invigorating. Paut cannot boost a drinker’s magic points 
past their normal maximum and has no effect on a drinker 
whose magic points are at maximum.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, 
Occult, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure 
that brewing directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names: none known.
