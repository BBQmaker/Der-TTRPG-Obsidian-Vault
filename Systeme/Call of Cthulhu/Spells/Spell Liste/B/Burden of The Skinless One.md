ing time: 20 hours
It is written that Sedefkar used this spell to bring down the 
horror of The Skinless One on the city of Constantinople. 
The spell requires ten human sacrifices, all skinned, and 
a series of unspeakable rituals performed on each in their 
death agonies, while a litany to Nyarlathotep is spoken. 
When enacted, it incites all humans within ten miles to 
commit acts of violence, unknowingly dedicated to The 
Skinless One. Those affected may attempt to resist the 
urge for violence with a successful Sanity roll.
Note: see Horror on the Orient Express for further 
information about Sedefkar and The Skinless One.Alternative names: none known.
