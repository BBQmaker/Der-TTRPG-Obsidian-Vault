Breath of The Deep 6
• Cost:  8 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The target’s lungs fill with seawater, potentially causing 
an unpleasant death by drowning. 
The caster must be able to see the target. After mentally 
intoning the spell for a round, the spell takes effect if 
the caster wins an opposed POW roll with the target. If 
successful, the target begins to drown—falling to the floor, 
choking on seawater, and taking 1D8 damage each round. 
The target should make an Extreme CON roll (equal to or 
below one-fifth CON) after taking damage each round, if the roll is successful the salt water has been expelled and 
the effects of the spell cease. Note that the caster may cease 
the spell at any point.
Alternative names: Currency of the Blue Sea, The Sailor’s 
Curse, Kiss of Brine.
