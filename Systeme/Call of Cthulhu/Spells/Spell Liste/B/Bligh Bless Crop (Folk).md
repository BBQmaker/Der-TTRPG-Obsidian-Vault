Blight/Bless Crop (Folk) 0
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
As the caster chooses, the spell causes one acre of 
vegetation to wither and die slowly as if parched, or to 
blossom and grow with vigor. The caster must plant a small 
animal’s skeleton (such as a bird, cat, or dog) within the 
area of land to be blessed or blighted.
“Blooding” the caster (striking the face hard enough to 
draw blood) breaks the spell, allowing the crop to return to 
health if conditions are suitable (if winter is coming there 
will not be enough time for the crop to mature).
Alternative names: The Farmer’s Hex, The Curse of Decay, 
Solstice Blessing.
