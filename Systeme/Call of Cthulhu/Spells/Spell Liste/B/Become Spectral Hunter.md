made figurine, the blood of several animals, and the loss 
SPECTRAL HUNTER
Large, hideous humanoids 7 feet in height, covered in rubbery, 
jet black flesh. Their red eyes, like their mouths filled with shark-
like teeth, are overly large. A long, tapering nose dangles from 
their face, and their bodies are horribly thin and reedy, with 
distended abdomen. Their limbs terminate in gross appendages, 
with feet resembling a man’s and hands that are more like huge 
crab-like pincers. Being slightly immaterial, they appear to float 
above the ground. Spectral hunters are formidable foes, often 
created to guard important sites or objects.
SPECIAL POWERS 
•
 Invisible: may become invisible at will, imposing one penalty 
die on attempts to hit them. 
•
 Invulnerability: when invisible, only enchanted weapons or 
spells may cause damage. However, certain forms of light 
can make the hunter visible—viewing the monster through 
a specially constructed lens or arrangement of lenses allows 
the hunter to be seen (negating its invulnerability).
•
 Binding: the life of the hunter is bound to that of the 
figurine that is used in its creation. The hunter can never be 
more than one mile away from the figurine. If this figurine is 
partially damaged the spectral hunter is injured (taking 1D8 
damage), whereas the complete destruction of the figurine 
means that the monster is dispelled, but may return in 7 days. 
Only by destroying the figurine and reciting the Chant of 
Dismissal effectively destroys the monster.

sof all Sanity points of the target of the spell. The target 
is transformed permanently and is essentially immortal.
The spectral hunter is linked to the specially prepared 
figurine and unable to venture far from the place in 
which the figurine resides. If the figurine is destroyed, 
the creature is dispelled; however, the creature is able to 
(magically) refashion a new figurine over the course of a 
week. Should the figurine be destroyed at the same time 
a “Chant of Dismissal” is spoken, the spectral hunter is 
banished permanently. 
See nearby box for information about spectral hunters.
Note: the Chant Of Dismissal was allegedly known by 
the Hotethk tribe of the Mojave Desert (who also knew 
how to create spectral hunters) and is said to have been 
transcribed by at least one visitor to the area before the 
Hotechk disappeared.
Deeper magic: by doubling the amount of POW invested 
in the spell to 32, the wizard creates an even more 
monstrous version of the spectral hunter, with double the 
STR, CON, SIZ, and hit points.

the Unseeing Watcher.
