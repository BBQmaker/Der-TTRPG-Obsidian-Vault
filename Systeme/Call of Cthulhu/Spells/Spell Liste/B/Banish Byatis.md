Banish Byatis 8
• Cost: var iable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting t
ime: 2 rounds
Forces the Great Old One, Byatis, back into its subterranean prison until summoned forth again. The 
caster may expend as many magic points as desired, and 
additional supporters present may donate 1 magic point 
each to the casting. Every person present loses 1D4 Sanity 
points. The caster multiplies the total number of magic 
points spent by five to give a percentage value, which is 
used in an opposed roll with Byatis’ POW of 160. For the 
spell to be cast successfully an Elder Sign must also be 
present. A statue of Byatis is not a requirement but having 
one present grants the caster +10% in the opposed roll, 
offering a better chance for a successful cast.
Note: information concerning Byatis can be found in 
Malleus Monstrorum.
Alternative names: Revoke Cyclopean Serpent; Cancellation 
of thou Abomination.
