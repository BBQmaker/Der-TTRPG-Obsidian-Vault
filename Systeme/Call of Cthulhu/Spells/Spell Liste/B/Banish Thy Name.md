Banish Thy Name C
• Cost:  12 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1+ nights
Using the target’s True Name, this spell allows a caster to
banish a target from this existence. The caster must prepare
a specially blessed rectangular silk paper on the night of the
new moon. Speaking aloud the target’s True Name (full birth
name), the caster writes the name of a specific person or being
on a piece of silk paper. Each night, the caster chants the
target’s name for an hour while the target sleeps (and each
night invests 12 magic points and loses 1D4 Sanity points).
Each night of casting, the caster makes an opposed
POW roll versus the target. If the caster succeeds, the
target loses 30 points from STR, DEX, SIZ, CON, INT,
and POW (the loss distributed as evenly as possible). The
target also suffers from horrible nightmares. If the caster
fails the opposed roll, he or she suffers a further loss of 1D4
Sanity points (if applicable). This process continues until
either the target’s STR, DEX, SIZ, CON, INT, and POW
are reduced to zero, meaning that they have faded from
existence—unless the caster is prevented from continuing
or stops the spell voluntarily. If the caster ultimately fails
to complete the spell (removing the target from existence),
the target’s characteristics return with bed rest (30 points
per day, back to their starting values).
If the target, who becomes weaker with each passing
day, is able to realize they are the focus of a curse, they
may attempt to seek out the caster to prevent the spell
from going any further. Of course, if the caster is killed,
the target is safe from further characteristic loss.
