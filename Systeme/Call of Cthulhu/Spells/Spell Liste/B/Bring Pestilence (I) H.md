Bring Pestilence (I) H C
• Cost:  10 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This foul spell causes the recipient to become infested 
with some dread disease. A piece of decayed human flesh is 
required for this spell. If the caster wins an opposed POW 
roll with the target the spell takes effect immediately, 
with the disease becoming apparent within 1D3 hours. 
At the Keeper’s discretion, the illness can vary but the 
effects are always the same. The target suffers the loss of 
2D10 points of CON as the infection spreads through 
their body, followed by the loss of 1D10 CON every day 
thereafter until the target’s CON reaches zero and they 
die. Of course, as CON is reduced, so are hit points. Also, 
all skills are performed with a penalty die.
The sick investigator may be cured with a successful 
Hard Medicine roll, while under professional medical care 
in a hospital or similar facility. A cured investigator will 
regenerate lost CON on a 5 per day basis until fully restored.
Deeper magic: particularly virulent and nasty diseases 
may be combined; thus, the target suffers from multiple 
agonies and maladies. Such lethal combinations may hasten 
the reduction in CON. Treatment may be more difficult, 
requiring an Extreme Medicine roll. The consequence 
of such an illness may leave a lasting effect, such as a 
permanent CON reduction (by 10 or 20 points), physical 
disfiguration (reducing APP), or necessitating amputation 
of a limb if a wasting disease (reducing STR and/or DEX).

of Attiquas, Oozing Bubbling Agonies of Intoxicating 
Repugnance.
