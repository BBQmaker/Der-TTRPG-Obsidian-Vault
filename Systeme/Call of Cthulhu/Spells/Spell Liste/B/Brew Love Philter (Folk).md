Brew Love Philter (Folk) 0
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D2 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 weeks
Creates a potion to cause one person to fall in love with 
another. The potion takes two weeks to brew, during which 
time the caster maintains a vigil over the simmering liquid 
for at least eight hours each day. The caster decides, at the 
beginning of the two-week period, how many magic points 
to infuse into the potion. 
A magus who creates a philter for another (whether for 
commercial or other reasons) must spend an additional 2 
magic points to bind it to that person, but this can be done 
at any time after the brewing is complete.
When a love philter is consumed, the one drinking it 
makes a POW roll opposed by the number of magic points 
invested in the philter’s creation multiplied by five. If the 
imbiber is successful, the beverage has no effect; if failed, they are attracted to the person the philter is bound to.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, 
Occult, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure 
that brewing directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names: Create Passion Potion, Liquor of the 
Heart’s Desire.
