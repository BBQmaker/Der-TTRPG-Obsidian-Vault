Black Box (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  24 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The spell’s 
target must be within 100 yards of the caster. A dark cloud 
of moaning voices, distorted faces, and clutching hands 
is formed, with sparkles of sickly light flashing within. 
The cloud engulfs and completely screens the target. It 
then warps and mutates the target into a horrifying half-
melted creature, only part human. The target’s INT and 
POW do not change, but APP is reduced by 9D10. Roll 
3D10 each for STR, CON, SIZ, and DEX: if the result is 
even, add it to the current score; if it is odd, subtract it. If 
CON is reduced to zero, the target dies. If SIZ is reduced 
to zero, the target is invisible. An APP of zero or less may 
cause anyone seeing the target to lose Sanity points, at the 
Keeper’s discretion. The spell’s target must make a Sanity 
roll (1D4/2D10 loss).  
Alternative names: Breath of Nightmare, The Black Curse 
of the Moon.
