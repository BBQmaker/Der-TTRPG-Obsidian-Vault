Blessing of Bast O
• Cost:  4 magic points

ing time: instantaneous
This rare spell is thought to have been lost to the passage of 
time, as it was known only to the High Priestesses of Bast 
and has rarely seen use since the days of dynastic Egypt. 
The spell heals 1D6 hit points and restores 1D6 Sanity 
points. The recipient of the spell must speak a prayer to Bast 
(outlined in the spell). The would-be recipient must make 
a successful POW roll to convince the goddess of their 
worthiness, and they should never have mistreated a cat. 
Failing the POW roll incurs the displeasure of the goddess 
and costs the caster 1 hit point damage, manifesting as 
claw marks on the face (a worse fate befalls those who have 
mistreated a cat, at the Keeper’s discretion). Alternative names: none known.
