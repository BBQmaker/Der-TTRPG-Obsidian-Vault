Banish Apep 8
• Cost: 10 magic points;  1D6 Sanity points
• Casting t
ime: 1 day
This ancient Egyptian ritual is meant to dispel the Great 
Old One known as Apep, the Eater of Souls. The ritual 
must be performed in a very precise order: after crafting 
a wax model or making a small drawing of Apep, the 
caster must spit upon the effigy while extolling the power 
of Ra. While still exalting the sun god, the caster grinds 
the effigy under his left heel, stabs it with a spear, ties it 
with a leather strap, slices it with a knife, and tosses the 
mutilated remains into a fire. The caster must continue 
this litany of Ra’s powers and deeds until the likeness of 
Apep is reduced to ash. Any event causing the distraction 
of the caster causes the spell to fail (Keepers may wish to 
impose a POW roll, at varying difficulty, should something 
have the potential to distract the caster).
If performed successfully, Apep is banished to the Land 
of the Dead (wherever that may be). In addition, any of 
Apep’s devoted followers within 1 mile of the casting 
suffers 1D8 points of damage.

Command Banish the Soul Eater.
