Body Warping of Gorgoroth n
• Cost:  6+ magic points; 5 POW; 2D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1D6+4 minutes
Allows the caster to change his or her physical form. 
The sorcerer can change to any shape and appearance, 
though retains personal abilities. The form is fleshly, but 
can appear to be made of stone, wood, a rug, etc. Once 
changed into a new shape, the caster has the mobility of 
that shape. The caster’s STR, CON, INT, POW and DEX 
do not change. If emulating a person, the sorcerer’s APP 
becomes that of the individual emulated. The caster can 
take on only a form known to them.
The caster invokes Nyarlathotep and repeats the 
phrases of the spell while expending 6 magic points and 
an additional magic point for each 5 points of SIZ to be 
gained or lost in the body warping. Only one alteration 
per casting is possible and the effect is permanent until 
the spell is recast to change back again. This spell cannot 
be cast on another being.
Deeper magic: if imitating an individual, the caster 
becomes a replica of that person, including voice and 
speech patterns. The caster does not need to repeat the 
spell to undo the warping—a simple verbal phrase is all 
that is required.
Alternative names:  Body Warping, Mastery of the Flesh, Skin 
Walking, The Black Pharaoh’s Transfiguration.
