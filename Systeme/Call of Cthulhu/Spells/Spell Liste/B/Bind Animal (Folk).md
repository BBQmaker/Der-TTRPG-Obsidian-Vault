Bind Animal (Folk) 0
• Cost:  2 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Directs a specific animal type to perform an action or 
limited series of actions.
Such spells include: Bind Driver Ant Column, Bind Cat, 
Bind Green Mamba, Bind Leopard, Bind Monkey Spider, 
Bind Rat, and so on. Each specific animal type comes with 
its own variant spell. Bind Driver Ant Column works on 
an entire ant swarm while Bind Leopard works on an 
individual of the species. Specific binding spells exist in 
native habitats, so are usually known by their respective 
sorcerers, African witch doctors, Amerind medicine men, 
European witches, etc. 
The commanded creature must be able to comprehend and 
perform the command. To instruct it to “fly to Mexico” has 
no meaning to a raccoon, and the instruction “kill Jonathan 
Kingsley” only baffles tarantulas as they have no way to 
identify a Mr. Kingsley. On the other hand, a command 
such as, “bite all nearby humans” could be attempted. 
Deeper Magic: some spellcasters are able to imbue an 
animal with a means of communication (speech, thought 
transference, and so on), allowing the animal to relate 
information to the caster; thus, allowing for a greater range 
of commands.
Alternative names: many variations.

Bind Enemy B
• Cost : variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day 
Either by physical or magical attack, this spell renders the 
target unable to harm the caster for the next seven days. A 
variable number of magic points are sacrificed into a  small 
effigy of the target—the caster must invest more magic 
points than the target possesses for the spell to work. For 
the spell to take effect the caster must win an opposed 
POW roll with the target. If the target wins, the spell fails. 
It normally takes a day to gather the materials, construct 
the effigy, and chant the ritual that seals the magic points 
into the effigy. The effigy must contain a portion of the 
target (this could be a few hairs, nail clippings, blood, or 
something else of a personal nature). 
The spell is broken if the caster attacks the target or if 
the effigy is destroyed.
Alternative names: Dispel Thy Enemy, The Darke Pact, Rite 
of Power.
