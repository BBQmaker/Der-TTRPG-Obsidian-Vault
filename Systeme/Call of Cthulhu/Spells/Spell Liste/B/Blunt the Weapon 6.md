Blunt the Weapon 6 2
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The caster causes all slashing and piercing weapons (swords, 
knives, bullets, etc.) to act as if blunted when striking the 
recipient of the spell (the caster or nominated target), 
and includes the natural weapons of creatures. The spell’s 
target, who must repeat a short magical phrase for the 
spell’s duration, suffers only half damage from such attacks 
(damage results from Extreme successes are also halved). 
The effect lasts for 6 rounds but may be extended at the 
further cost of 6 magic points per 2 additional rounds.
Deeper magic: at a greater cost (12 magic points; 4 Sanity 
points) the spell negates all damage from slashing or 
piercing weapons, except for Extreme successes (which 
still deal half damage).
Alternative names: The Song of Corrosion, Turn Skin, Steely 
Flesh.
