This magical recipe, said to have been originally used by 
serpent people, requires a number of hard to obtain and illegal 
ingredients, including fresh poppy tar and bear’s spleen. The final 
product is a thick ichor that pacifies and disorients the mind.
Laced into a target’s food or drink, it erodes their will 
for a number of days equal to one-fifth of the character’s 
POW, leaving them subject to the demands of whoever has 
administered the drug (effectively setting them up to be 
“brainwashed”). The target soon adopts the viewpoints and 
beliefs of the manipulator. After 2 to 3 weeks, use of the 
drug is no longer necessary, and the mental alterations to 
the target are complete. At no time does a target lose their 
personality, nor does their behavior exhibit changes (other 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
than those sought by the person who has administered 
the drug). Extended therapy might undo the alterations 
wrought by this hypnotic drug.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, 
Occult, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure 
that directions are carefully followed.
Deeper magic: the original serpent folk brew is believed 
to work totally after a single dose is administered, greatly 
reducing the time and amount required to prepare the target.
Alternative names: Draft of Wilderness, Mind Control 
Toxin.
