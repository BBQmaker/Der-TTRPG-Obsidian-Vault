Brew Space-Mead (I) H
• Cost: 20 magic points (per dose); variable additional 
magic and Sanity points
• Casting time: 7+ days
Creates a magical drink that allows a human to withstand 
journeys through the vacuum and vicissitudes of space. 
Brewing the drink and taking the journey represent 
separate stages for the caster and user (who may different). 
Different strains of space-mead exist, each providing the 
same effects but all of them requiring different ingredients.
Brewing space-mead requires five special ingredients 
(chosen by the Keeper) and requires at least a week of 
brewing time. Once the mead is foaming and bubbling, 
the caster must sacrifice 20 magic points per dose into the 
brew. Magic points may be sacrificed over a  number of 
days; the more points, the more doses. Each dose allows 
one person to withstand one journey through space of 
varying distance and time. 
Once the space-mead has been enchanted, the traveler 
must find a means of transportation—usually a mount: 
among others, the spell Summon and Bind Byakhee  (page 
175 and 42) can provide an interstellar steed. For all such journeys, the effectiveness of space-mead 
also requires the expenditure of an equal number of magic 
points and Sanity points, commensurate to the journey’s 
distance in light years by the traveler taking the drug (see 
Space-Mead Effectiveness Table). The traveler drinks 
the dose (presumably bringing an extra dose for the 
return trip), climbs on, commands the mount and the 
journey begins. It is at this point that the traveler pays 
the necessary magic and Sanity point cost subject to the 
distance being traveled. While in space, the traveler exists 
in a mental and physical stasis, nearly insensible to their 
surroundings. Upon arrival at the destination, the effects 
of the brew conclude and normality returns.

Theoretically, 10 magic points and 10 Sanity points might 
be enough to reach any point in the universe, at least as we 
understand the universe…
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, or 
Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure that brewing 
directions are carefully followed.
