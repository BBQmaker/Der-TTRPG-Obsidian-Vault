Bind Were-Creature 8
• Cost:  14 magic points; 2D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Removes a were-creature’s desire to control its shape-
changing, quickly condemning it to the life as whatever 
form the entity’s alternate form takes. A creature so bound 
sheds its human side and permanently becomes wild.
Once the spell is cast, the target steadily loses its ability 
to choose when to shape-change. More and more it becomes 
the animal alternate when primal emotions, such as rage, 
fear, lust, or hunger become strong. The shape-change is 
no longer a conscious choice.The effect strengthens over 
time. After 1D6 days, the target spends half its time in its 
animal form. After another 1D6 days the human side is 
utterly unattractive and tedious. The creature then lives as an animal in the wild.s

To perform this spell, the caster needs a bowl of solid 
silver or gold. The bowl must be inscribed with the 
incantations of the spell on its inner surface. The caster 
must also carve a circular talisman into the surface of the 
area where the spell is to be cast. Six candles are placed 
and lit clockwise around this talisman. Once the candles 
are lit, the caster may not leave the circle. At least six drops 
of human blood must be added to the bowl. To target an 
individual, place something of the target in the bowl (hair, 
fingernail clippings, personal possessions, etc.). More than 
one person may be targeted at a time. Incantations must 
be chanted without interruption for an hour. If all goes 
well, the bowl briefly glows and the spell begins its work.
After the spell is cast, the target experiences growing 
fears and desires based on the need of its animal side and 
loses no Sanity unless it understands what has happened to 
it; then the Sanity loss is 1D3+1 points per day, until one-
fifth POW days have passed. Then it loses all remaining 
SAN and (as a human) is permanently insane.
