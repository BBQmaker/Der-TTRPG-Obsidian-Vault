Bloat (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  16 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The spell’s 
target must be within 30 yards of the caster. If the caster 
wins an opposed POW roll against the target, the target 
swells to immense proportions, their movement is reduced 
to 1, and all physically active skills (such as any combat 
skill, Climb, Jump, Ride, Throw, etc.) are reduced to 05%. 
This effect wears off in a number of days equal to 30 minus 
one-fifth the target’s SIZ; so a SIZ 50 target would be 
bloated for 20 days: 30 –(50/5). Alternative names: The Fattening Curse.
