Bestow Glimpse of Truth 6 B
• Cost:  10 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Causes a target to suffer temporary insanity. An opposed 
POW roll is made with the spell’s target. If the caster 
succeeds, the target loses 5 Sanity points and becomes 
temporarily insane.
While this spell is similar to Mindblast (page 142), there 
are two differences: the target can voluntarily choose to 
relinquish the opposed POW roll, thus the spell succeeds 
automatically. Also, the substance of the target’s madness is 
dictated by the caster’s perceptions—the “truth” bestowed is 
the caster’s own perception of the true nature of reality and, 
consequently, may be false, misaligned, or only partially 
true in terms of the grand cosmic reality of the universe.

Transference, Willful Visage of the Hidden Realm.
