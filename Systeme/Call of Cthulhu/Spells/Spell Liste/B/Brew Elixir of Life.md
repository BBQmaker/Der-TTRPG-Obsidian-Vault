Brew Elixir of Life
• Cost: 20 magic points; 10 POW; 10 Sanity points to  brew
• Casting time: 6 months
A variant of an ancient alchemical formula that purports to extended life indefinitely. This elixir, which includes the blue ichor secreted from a hound of [[Tindalos]], actually converts a human into a hybrid [[Tindalos|Tindalosian]]. Ingredients for the elixir include diamond dust, blood of an infant (5 liters, boiled down into a tar), and numerous odd herbs. Values vary, dependent on time period, at the Keeper’s discretion.
Without the [[Tindalos|Tindalosian]] ichor, the elixir is only a foultasting drink. With the ichor, and if the herbs are rotten (which introduces agents that react with the ichor) it has a very different effect. The drinker feels like the elixir is rotting their insides out, until it is excreted. For one day, the substance courses through their alimentary tract, causing incredible pain; they are unable to do anything
besides hunch over and scream in agony.
They also feel their soul being “chewed on,” provoking a Sanity roll (1D4/2D6 loss). Over the course of the day before the ichor is excreted, it sucks away 10 POW and 10 CON points. The person also needs to be fed through a tube for the rest of his or her life. Once the ichor is excreted, a POW roll is made: with an Extreme success, the drinker begins to transform into a human hybrid [[Tindalos|Tindalosian]] (see box on page 48 for details).
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure that brewing directions are carefully followed.

Alternative names: none known.
