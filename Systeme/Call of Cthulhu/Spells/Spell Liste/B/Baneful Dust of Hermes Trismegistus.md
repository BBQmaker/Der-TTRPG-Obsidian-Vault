Baneful Dust of Hermes Trismegistus 6
• Cost: 4 magic points
• Casting t
ime: 24 hours (1 round to use)
Similar to the Dust Of Suleiman (page 102), this spell only 
affects creatures of non-terrestrial origin (that excludes 
humans, deep ones, ghouls, sand dwellers, serpent people, 
etc., but not flying polyps, elder things, mi-go, or star-
spawn of Cthulhu, and so on). Anyone may use the gold-
colored dust created by the spell. 
The dust’s effects are horrible and cost sensitive 
observers 0/1D3 Sanity points to see. A creature covered 
in the dust flinches and flails, and sometimes screams. 
Its body smokes and burns, as if eaten by powerful acid. 
Only the most fearsome entities continue to fight after an 
application of this terrible dust. 
To apply the dust requires that the target be within 
throwing range. With a successful Throw roll, the dust burns 
the extraterrestrial creature for 2D6 points of damage. Armor 
does not protect against the dust. Each successful throw of 
the dust causes the same damage. If the Throw is missed, the 
nimbus of the dust still inflicts 1 hit point of damage. The 
creature escapes damage only if the Throw roll is fumbled.
The formula for the dust requires uncommon chemicals 
and ingredients in a proportion of combined weight roughly 
equal to two pounds. Two ounces of this concoction is 
enough for one dose. Sixteen doses can be made each time 
the formula is prepared. Brewing the dust is a consuming 
job, taking 24 hours to prepare and dry the mixture. 4 magic 
points are invested, and a successful Science (Chemistry, 
Pharmacy) or Medicine roll is required for a batch to work; 
the Keeper should make this roll in secret, as the caster 
should have no idea if a batch will be effective.
Alternative names: Rain of Doom, Curse of the Seven Senses, 
Bane of the Hell Spawn.
