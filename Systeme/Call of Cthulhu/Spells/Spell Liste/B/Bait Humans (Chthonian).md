Bait Humans (Chthonian)
• Cost:  1 magic point
• Casting time: 1 round
An illusion (visible only to the target) of a fabulously large 
and beautifully cut diamond floats in the air before the target’s 
eyes. As the target approaches the illusion, the object recedes 
at approximately the same speed, in the direction the caster 
wills, presumably to where a hungry chthonian waits. As in 
sport fishing, the target decides whether to take the bait.
It is thought that only chthonians know this spell, as a 
variation exists called Bait Sand Dwellers, which exchanges 
the image of a floating diamond for that of a tender 
human haunch, dripping fresh blood. However, one or 
two tomes suggest that some power-crazed sorcerers may 
have succeeded in transcribing this spell for their own use.
The spell lasts for five minutes and can be repeated 
indefinitely (paying 1 magic point per use). Approximate range of the spell is one mile. 
Deeper magic: it is hinted that an alternative version of the 
spell exists, known only to the most powerful and ancient 
of wizards. In this rare version, the target is enchanted to 
see his or her heart’s desire, be it gold, a lost love one, or 
something else. It is unlikely this version of the spell could 
be found written in any tomes, existing only within the 
insane minds of deathless sorcerers. If such a spell were 
to be found, there would certainly be a Sanity cost to pay.
Alternative names: The Rite of Feeding, Allure of the Weak, 
Jewel of Desire.
