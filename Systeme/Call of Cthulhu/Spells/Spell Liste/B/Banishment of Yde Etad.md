 Cast
ing time: variable (minimum 1 hour)
Banishes most trans-dimensional human or human-
like intelligences. It is not effective against any creature 
commanded by another intelligence. Correctly performed, 
the banishment is permanent and irrevocable. The 
banishment is directed at an individual target, rather than 
a type or genus of monsters.
At least three people must participate in the spell 
(and each pays the spell’s cost). All participants must 
have learned the spell. More participants add to the 
effectiveness; however, the total number of participants 
must be divisible by three.The spell must be performed in the open air in the 
middle of the night, ideally in a place of power associated 
with the target. This could be known haunts, its last known 
location, or its point of entry into this dimension. The 
spellcasters must divide their numbers: one-third should 
remain outside a protective circle, while the rest stand 
within.
This banishment works by destroying, with ritual flames, 
a sigil representing the target. The target’s personal sigil 
is ideal but a substitute can be prepared according to a 
formula described within the spell. For the spell to take 
effect an opposed POW roll must be made between the 
caster with the highest POW and the target; +5% is 
granted to the caster’s POW for each additional set of 
three casters.
