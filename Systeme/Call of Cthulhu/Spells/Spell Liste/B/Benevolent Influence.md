Benevolent Influence n
• Cost: 10 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: 3 days
This arduous spell exacts many requirements from the 
caster: a regimen of meditation and breathing exercises, 
along with a strictly prescribed diet, must be followed for 
three solar months before the spell may be attempted. 
When ready, the caster must fast for three days and then 
enact the ritual, which involves an hour of chanting, 
the sacrifice of 10 magic points, and a successful Hard 
POW roll by the caster. If successful, the spell magnifies 
the willpower of the caster, making them more able to 
influence and manipulate people. For one solar month, 
the caster’s APP rises by 10, and a bonus die is granted 
to Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, and Persuade rolls. As 
long as the diet and meditations continue, the spell can 
be re-cast each month.
Alternative names: Ritual of Authority, Aura of Control, 
The Agreeable Tongue of Festus.
