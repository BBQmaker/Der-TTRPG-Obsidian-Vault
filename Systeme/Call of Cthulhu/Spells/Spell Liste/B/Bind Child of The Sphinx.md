Bind Child of The Sphinx 8
• Cost:  3 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This Egyptian chant allows the caster to impose their will 
on a child of the Sphinx. The caster makes an opposed 
POW roll against the child. If the caster actually created 
the child of the Sphinx (see Create Child of The Sphinx, 
page 83), the caster receives a bonus die to the opposed 
roll. If the caster wins the POW roll, the child follows 
commands to the best of its ability, including self-destructive commands. Control lasts for a number of 
months equal to one-fifth of the caster’s POW. Subsequent 
control may be renewed through additional castings. If the 
child wins the POW roll, it immediately attacks the caster.
Deeper magic: knowledge and use of this spell can usurp 
control of a child of the Sphinx already bound to another. 
The caster makes an opposed POW roll against the current 
master of the creature: if the usurping caster wins, they 
immediately gain control. Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Children of the Sphinx.
Alternative names: Dominion of the Jackals, Authority of 
the Sands.
