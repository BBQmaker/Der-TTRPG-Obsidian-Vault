 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
The caster calls upon the forces of nature, focusing strong 
swirling winds. In a desert or among coastal dunes this has 
the effect of producing a sandstorm. Variations of the spell 
appear to have been written based upon local geography 
and beliefs, as in each the caster is required to call upon 
a different Mythos god, such as Amon-Gorloth, Shudde 
M’ell, and Ithaqua.
The whirling storm is roughly 20 miles across, with 
winds averaging 30 miles per hour and gusts of roughly 
twice that. Apply appropriate penalties or increase 
difficulty levels in line with the actions of characters caught 
in the storm.
Deeper magic: stronger and more violent winds may be called, 
which may cause terrible devastation for an increase in the 
spell’s costs.
Alternative names: Bring Sandstorm, The Djinn’s Bloody 
Tickle, The Hand that Bends the Tree.
