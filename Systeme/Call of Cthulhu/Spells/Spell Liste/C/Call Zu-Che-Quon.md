Call Zu-Che-Quon 9
• Cost:  15 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points 
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
Requires three enchanted bells (see Enchant Bells of Horror, page 107) to ring in order to perform the 
summoning ritual. Unlike other Call Deity spells, the spell 
is always successful, the bells only need to be continually 
rung—knowledge of Zu-Che-Quon is not required as the 
ringing invokes the spell—the spell’s cost is automatically 
taken from the person ringing the bells. Should the bells 
stop ringing, Zu-Che-Quon descends back to the darkness 
from whence it came. 
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Zu-Che-Quon.
Alternative names: Rise up the Silent Darkness.
