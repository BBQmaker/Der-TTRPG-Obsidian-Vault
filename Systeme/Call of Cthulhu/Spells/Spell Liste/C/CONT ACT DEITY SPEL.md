CONT ACT DEITY SPELLS
• Cost: 5 POW; 1D6 Sanity points (plus more to view 
the entity)
•
 Cast
ing time: 1D6 + 4 rounds
Contact Deity spells are unused except by the insane 
priests of these deities or by great independent sorcerers 
who hope to strike deals and win some small fraction 
of the deity’s powers. The deities sought for contact are 
many and varied. 
The chance of successfully contacting the deity is equal 
to half the caster’s POW (reduced after paying 5 POW 
cost). If the Hard POW roll succeeds, the deity (or some 
aspect of it) will contact the caster in a semi-friendly 
manner after a few hours or days. The deity is unlikely 
to give non-worshipers anything of value. If the deity is 
bored or offended, it will likely squash the caster or drive 
him or her insane.
A range of Contact Deity spells follow; the list is not 
exhaustive. The cost for each spell is the same unless noted 
otherwise.
Alternatives names: each spell name usually reflects 
elements of the deity, its name, sphere of influence, powers, 
and so on. For example: Call Down the Opener of the Way, 
Entreat the Daemon Sultan, Give Praise to He who Slumbers 
beneath the Waters.
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Contact Abhoth 9
Known by witches as the “Aklo of the Sabaoth,” this spell 
may be cast only on clear nights when the moon is in its first 
phase. Completing an incantation, the caster must attempt 
a Luck roll: if successful, they fall into a deep slumber and 
visit the Source of Uncleanness in a dream. If the caster 
is near a terrestrial manifestation of Abhoth (the caverns 
under Dunwich, for instance, or Mount Voormithadreth 
in Hyperborea, now buried under ice in Greenland), then 
Abhoth speaks directly to the caster through one of its 
malformed spawn, which grows out of the Outer God and 
crawls to the caster; Wilbur Whateley termed such spawn 
as “They of the Hill.” In any case, the caster must make an 
opposed POW roll versus Abhoth to initiate meaningful 
communication; success and failure are equally disastrous. 
If the caster succeeds, Abhoth converses telepathically with 
the caster (if contacted in person, the caster is possessed by 
Abhoth, who then walks the hapless body down into its 
caverns and devours it). If the caster fails, Abhoth consumes 
the dreaming caster’s consciousness, leaving the sleeper in a 
permanent coma from which they never wake.
Contact Aku-Shin Kage   
(Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
Opens communication with the Aku-Shin Kage, an avatar 
of Nyarlathotep rumored to appear in Japan. May be cast 
only on the night of a new moon or deep within a cavern 
where no sun can reach. If the Aku-Shin Kage contacts the 
caster, usually among a group of worshipers, it will appear 
as the shadow of an armored samurai on a wall. Someone 
present, but not the caster, will begin to bleed profusely 
from their orifices (eyes, ears, and even fingernails), causing 
witnesses to make a Sanity roll (0/1D6 loss). Until it leaves, 
the avatar speaks through the bleeding victim in harsh 
unnatural whispers. The host loses 1 hit point every three 
rounds until the avatar departs (if hit points are depleted, 
death follows as soon as the avatar departs).
Contact Azathoth 9
Opens communication with the boundless entity who 
dwells at the center of the universe. This is an exceptionally 
dangerous undertaking. The spell creates a magical portal 
which transports the caster directly to the Court of 
Azathoth. Should be cast in the dead of night under the 
clearest of skies, so that brilliant stars blanket the night 
sky. The caster plays a pipe or flute for at least one hour 
before the spell becomes active. 
The caster makes a Hard POW roll to determine if the 
portal has been created successfully. Note that in cities, 
due to light pollution, the spell has a reduced chance of 
working (a penalty die is applied to the POW roll).Incorrectly performing this spell results in the instantaneous 
incineration of the caster. The successful sorcerer may bargain 
for their desires; however, Azathoth is likely to obliterate the 
caster unless they can appease and amuse the blind idiot god 
(even then, remember the potential of 1D100 Sanity loss).
Azathoth offers little in return for worship. 
It is written that those who seek to speak with Azathoth and 
who do not first petition the Outer God, Tru’nembra, to teach 
them the music of the cosmos, are doomed to failure and death.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Tru’nembra.
Contact Bokrug (Dreamlands) 9
Must be cast in or near a swamp or lake within the 
Dreamlands. A representation (statuette, icon, etc.) of the 
Great Old One must be present. Bokrug only responds if 
his own interests are somehow involved. Wise sorcerers 
often take care in making sure they have a valid reason for 
awakening the Great Old One.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Bokrug.
Contact Byatis 9
May only be successfully cast in the Severn River Valley, 
England. The spell involves performing ritual devotions to a 
representation of the Great Old One. Byatis appears in a vision 
and the caster must make a successful POW roll to avoid the 
god’s hypnotic gaze. Byatis is unlikely to grant the caster’s 
wishes unless the caster can demonstrate their willingness to 
help free the deity from its Elder-warded prison.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Byatis.
Contact Chaugnar Faugn 9
The caster must prepare a sumptuous and lavish meal in honor 
of the Great Old One, and then gorge upon it until they 
can eat no more and pass out. With success, the spell opens 
communication with the deity, with Chaugnar Faugn sending 
the caster visions or nightmares that relate the god’s desires. 
Contact Cthulhu 9
May  be performed anywhere. Usually a representation 
of the Great Old One is used during a ritual involving 
some form of blood sacrifice. Cthulhu typically responds 
at night, while the caster is sleeping, sending vivid dreams 
through which he informs his followers of his desires and 
the tasks he requires of them. Certain dream-sent visions 
may provoke Sanity rolls and cause outbursts of artistic s

mania, where the recipient feels compelled to draw, make, 
or compose works of representative art concerning Cthulhu 
and his foul plans.
Contact Eihort 9
Resembles other Contact Deity spells but the caster 
sacrifices 1 magic point instead of 5 POW in casting it. 
The god appears in dream form if the caster is distant, 
and in person if within a few hundred yards. If this spell is 
learnt directly from Eihort (or when it is first cast) Eihort 
extracts 5 POW in payment.
Contact Emerald Lama (Avatar of Hastur) 9
Opens communication with the Emerald Lama, an avatar 
of Hastur. The spell is cast by chanting a mantra 108 times. 
The chant is said to be written down in the Forbidden 
Sutra. If the Emerald Lama deigns to open communication, 
a vision of a floating being dressed in shimmering green 
robes appears to the caster. The avatar will answer up to 
three questions pertaining to the nature of enlightenment 
and the cosmic truth, but will always answer in riddles. If 
the answer involves the Cthulhu Mythos, the avatar may 
replace the image of itself with a scene of the Mythos 
event rendered in a pale green light. Such scenes could 
include the slumbering form of Cthulhu, the Court of 
Azathoth, and so on. Witnesses lose Sanity points equal to 
those lost for a successful Sanity roll for the real situation 
(thus, 1D10 Sanity points for seeing Cthulhu). If the caster 
asks questions specifically about the Emerald Lama, the 
avatar will instantly disappear, leaving the Mark of the 
Lama upon the caster: an all-consuming obsessive desire to 
discover more about the avatar to the exclusion of all else.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
the Emerald Lama.
Contact Ghroth 9
Requires a successful Astronomy roll, so that the Outer 
God, Ghroth, may be reached at the proper time. The caster 
is attuned to the planet-sized entity’s alien mind, provoking 
a Sanity roll (1D8/5D10 loss). There appear to be no true 
benefits for contacting Ghroth, as the caster is so puny and 
insignificant Ghroth will not acknowledge them. Perhaps in 
contacting the ever-traveling Ghroth, some small portion 
of the inhuman songs heard only by the pitiless stars and 
the dead Old Ones can be understood; who can say what 
enlightenment such strange melodies can bring?
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Ghroth.Contact Gla’aki 9
Should be cast in areas where Gla’aki has influence: 
usually by water and near to shards of his Elder prison. It 
is unusual for Gla’aki to appear at the first summons of a 
caster; normally, it will send 1D6 of its servants to treat 
with the caster. The offer of “undying” servitude to Gla’aki 
is often the first subject discussed.
Contact Iod 9
A rare spell but believed to have been written down in De 
Vermis Mysteriis, where it is known as “Call to the Hunter.” 
The caster must stare into a blindingly bright light while 
chanting the rhythmic words of summoning. Any source 
of exceptionally bright light is acceptable. A successful 
POW roll avoids permanent blindness, whereas a Hard 
success means the spell has succeeded. After a brief time, 
Iod will begin to speak to the caster’s mind—to witnesses, 
the caster appears to be a crazy person staring at the sun 
and mumbling. 
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about Iod.
Contact Koth 9
Attracts the attention of the Lord of Koth, a mysterious 
entity said to dwell in the Dreamlands. The caster burns 
an elaborate offering comprising of incense and arcane 
diagrams. For the spell to activate the caster must make a 
Hard Luck roll: if successful, an avatar of Koth will visit 
the caster at the next full moon. Some accounts speak of 
Malik Tous, an infamous wizard—claimed by some to be 
an avatar of Koth in human form—visiting the caster. If 
the caster sufficiently impresses the avatar, it will describe 
how to journey to the fabled city of Koth, where his 
Cowled Lord will offer the caster long life, wealth, and 
wisdom in return for the caster’s soul.
Contact Nodens 9
Can be cast only from a remote, unpeopled place, such 
as the edge of a sea-cliff. Nodens is unlikely to respond 
immediately; usually the Elder God will contact the caster 
at a later point, when he or she is alone and in a similar 
remote or inaccessible place. Nodens has been recorded as 
providing aid to those who most require it; however, he is 
also known to ignore requests. Whatever “aid” he might 
bring, it is unlikely to be exactly what is desired, but rather 
esoteric in nature and form.
Contact Nyarlathotep 9
May be cast from anywhere, as befits this omnipresent 
entity. Nyarlathotep is said to appear only at gatherings 
of worshipers, or when new priests are anointed; however, Opposite: Sigil of Nyarlathotep by Goomi

throughout history, avatars of the Crawling Chaos have 
been recorded as appearing before individuals to deliver 
gifts in return for nameless bargains. The nature of such 
gifts appears varied, yet all appear to have a sting in the 
tail as befits the Outer God’s mockery of humanity. 
Note: other Contact spells specifically concerning one of 
Nyarlathotep’s avatars exist; some examples are included here.
Contact Nyarlatophis (Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
Specifically directed at an avatar of Nyarlathotep named 
Nyarlatophis. This aspect appears as a young, healthy man 
dressed as an Egyptian Pharaoh, or a man with no face 
(instead, there is a star-filled void of cosmic emptiness). 
Sometimes mistaken for the Black Pharaoh. 
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Nyarlatophis.
Contact Othuyeg 9
An exceedingly rare spell used to attract the attention 
of Othuyeg, an obscure Great Old One, said to be 
imprisoned beneath the earth in the Seven Cities of Gold, 
under the lost realm of Cakatomia. The spell describes 
Othuyeg as a benevolent spirit guide, “The keeper of all 
ancient wisdom,” and gives little clue as to the entity’s 
true motivations. The caster ingests a mixture of rare herbs 
and then offers a blood sacrifice. Othuyeg will contact 
the caster in dreams, granting them terrifying visions of 
Cakatomia, Othuyeg, and the fabulous golden cities. The 
telepathic contact lasts a full lunar month (28 days), and 
each night the nightmares provoke a Sanity roll (0/1D2 
loss). At the end of this period, the caster makes a POW 
roll: if failed, the caster becomes obsessed with releasing Othuyeg from his prison; stopping at nothing to free the 
Doom Walker. 
In some obscure texts, Othuyeg is confused or conflated 
with Cyaegha—whether the two deities are one and the 
same has led to much speculation. 
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Othuyeg.
Contact Pazzuzu (Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
Beseeches the attention of Pazzuzu, an avatar of 
Nyarlathotep taking the form of a Babylonian deity. The 
caster makes an Extreme POW roll to successfully cast 
this spell. Should he deign to appear, Pazzuzu manifests 
only if there are graves or death nearby. On appearing, 
Pazzuzu’s breath is said to be so foul as to cause death in 
all but his faithful followers.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Pazzuzu.
Contact Shub-Niggurath 9
May be performed in a wilderness under the open sky, at 
the dark of the moon. Fresh blood is poured over a wooden 
or stone alter while the petitioner calls forth and begs the 
Dark Mother to listen. If successful, the Outer God usually 
sends a herald to “speak” on her behalf, which could be 
some mutated woodland creature, a dark young, or some 
other abomination. 
Contact Tsathoggua 9
Usually performed under the ground, ideally in a cavern 
or grotto, or in a temple dedicated to the Great Old One. 
An offering must be provided while the caster performs a guttural ritual. Tsathoggua may appear as a hazy and 
translucent vision (standard Sanity roll and losses apply). 
In the main, descriptions speak of the entity appearing alone; 
however, at least one account tells his arrival was heralded by 
the appearance of a number of his formless spawn attendants.
Contact Y’golonac 9
May be performed anywhere. Some versions of this spell 
warn the uninitiated reader that Y’golonac greatly desires 
servitude from those who would call his name. The Great 
Old One is unlikely to appear before one who is not 
already a devotee; instead, a herald might visit with the 
purpose of converting the caster to Y’golonac’s will. In 
some situations, where Y’golonac manifests before the 
caster, it will psychically attack those it deems unsuitable, 
or possess some present so that they may go forth to 
further his work (tempting others into his service).
AVATARS OF NYARLATHOTEP

of Nyarlathotep’s avatars. This list is by no means exhaustive.

Contact Yig 9
The caster prepares a noxious red potion from the poison 
glands of a sacred snake of Yig. A prepared sacrifice is made 
to drink the potion, which induces painful muscle spasms. 
During the convulsions, the sacrifice is strapped upon 
an altar, while attendants chant the ritual. If the spell is 
successful, a child of Yig bursts from the sacrifice’s stomach. 
Yig converses with the caster for a few minutes through 
this horrific snake. When the Father of Serpents departs, 
the sacrifice’s torso bursts forth with 2D10 sacred snakes.
Contact Yog-Sothoth 9
Must be cast at a specially constructed stone tower, at 
least 10 yards high, in an open, cloudless area. A sacrifice 
is offered and the ritual called out. If Yog-Sothoth takes a 
dislike to the caster(s), the god may instantly destroy the 
sorcerer or transport him or her through time and space, 
placing the caster in any dimensional reality Yog-Sothoth 
desires. The full, unfettered appearance of this entity will 
cause rifts in the fabric of space-time. Localized effects 
may include freak weather, strange noises, appearance of 
extra-terrestrial entities, and periods of “missing time.”
Yog-Sothoth may deign to appear as Tawil at’Umr (an 
avatar form)—a being not exactly permanent in outline, 
though transiently paralleling human form and half again 
as large. Mysteriously cloaked in swathes of heavyset cloth, 
its face is obscured by many deep folds. No Sanity loss 
unless Tawil at’ Umr removes its protective cloak, in which 
a Sanity roll is required (1D20/1D100 loss). Manifesting as 
Tawil at’Umr greatly reduces localized space-time effects.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Tawil at’Umr.
Contact Zhar and Lloigor 9
An ancient ritual of the tcho-tcho, the spell allows for two 
forms of contact:
•
 A) The Dhzou Tul Dop, or “Lesser revelation of the 
form,” involves an hour-long ceremony of tantric 
dancing and human sacrifice. During the ritual, each 
participant invests 2 magic points, and each sacrifice 
gives their magic points to the total pool of points—
this sum becomes the percentile chance that the spell 
will work. If successful, the Twin Obscenity projects its 
Tulku (spirit form) to the assembly; a spectral vision of 
the god, who is then venerated in orgiastic rites. 
•
 B) The Ta’ang Zhaat Mung’aa, or “Ritual of True 
Communion,” is reserved for tcho-tcho priests. Most 
of this ritual is actually a recipe for K’lao Up Phong, 
a confection of black lotus and other hallucinogenic herbs, mixed with human blood, brain tissue, and spinal 
fluid. During the brewing process, the caster sacrifices 
5 POW and 10 magic points, and then eats the dish 
(costing 1D6 Sanity points). If successful (requiring a 
Hard Luck roll), the following night the caster enters prolonged mental contact with Zhar and Lloigor.
Contact Zoth-Ommog 9
Requires an idol of the god to function. The infamous 
Ponape Figurine would be ideal but, where such an artifact 
is not available, the caster must create one. Once carved, 
the idol is enchanted with a sacrifice of 5 POW (once 
enchanted, the statuette will work indefinitely). 
The caster makes a blood sacrifice to the idol while 
performing the ritual. If successful, Zoth-Ommog’s essence 
will inhabit the statue, animating it and telepathically 
communicating with the caster. Once this spell has been 
cast, the statuette exudes an air of menace and those who 
see it, or who spend significant amounts of time near it, 
must make a Sanity roll (0/1D3 loss).
