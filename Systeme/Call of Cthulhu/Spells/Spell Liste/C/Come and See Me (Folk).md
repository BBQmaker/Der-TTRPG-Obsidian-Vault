Incites a feeling of love in the target of the spell. The spell 
requires the construction of a white, anthropomorphic 
candle containing fine olive oil and elements taken from 
the target (a lock of the target’s hair, a fragment of their 
clothing, fingernail clippings, etc.). The candle is lighted and an incantation spoken. Thereafter, for one week, 
whenever the caster meets the target, an opposed POW 
roll is made: if the caster succeeds, they temporarily gain 
+20 APP and a bonus die to all Charm, Fast Talk, and 
Persuade rolls when interacting with the target. The first 
time the caster wins such an opposed POW roll, the target 
loses 1D4 Sanity points. If the target wins the opposed 
POW roll, this spell has no further effect.
