Crystal World (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  8+ magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The spell 
costs 8 magic points per hour of duration. A glassy sphere 
(7-foot diameter) forms around the caster, who is thereby 
insulated against extremes of heat and cold. Even if the 
caster is flung into a blast furnace, they are safe so long 
as they maintain the Crystal World. The globe is airtight, 
and continually generates fresh air so the magician cannot 
asphyxiate. The magician inside cannot move except by clumsily rolling the globe along the ground, by being towed, 
or pushed by outsiders. The globe could be broken by a 
sharp blow (causing at least 5 damage) or an explosive spell.
Alternative names: Sphere of Fiery Redemption, The Ball 
of K’Petel.
