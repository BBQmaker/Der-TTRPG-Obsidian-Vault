 Cast
ing time: 10 minutes
Compels a ghost to come forth to answer specific 
questions. The casting must be performed at night. A 
mammal’s blood is poured upon the grave or ashes of the 
dead person whom the caster wishes to contact. The spirit 
will be reluctant to re-enter this world, so for the spell to 
take effect the caster must make an opposed POW roll in 
order to force it to appear. Sanity loss for viewing the ghost 
varies with the ghost, which appears in its form at death.
The ghost summoned by this spell responds to questions 
about events occurring while the spirit lived. Each question 
costs the caster one magic point (and another opposed 
POW roll at the Keeper’s discretion if the questions are 
troubling for the spirit). When the caster loses an opposed 
POW roll, or when a game hour elapses, the spirit departs.
Alternative names: Compel Spirit, Whisper of Ashes, Dead Tongue.
