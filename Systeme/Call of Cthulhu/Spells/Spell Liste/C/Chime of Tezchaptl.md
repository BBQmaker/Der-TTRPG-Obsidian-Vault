Chime of Tezchaptl 2
• Cost:  10 magic points; 10 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 6 hours
The caster enchants a small bell or chime made of a pure 
metal, such as silver, gold, or iron. For each 100 feet above sea 
level, the effectiveness of the created chime increases by one 
percentile: made at 5,500 feet, a chime works 55% of the time 
it is rung. Additionally, the caster must enact the Unspeakable 
Promise (page 182), imperiling his or her Sanity and life.
The resulting chime defends against many spells that require 
song or musical instruments in their casting, for example: Free 
Hastur, Song of Hastur, Dampen Light, and Soul Singing. 
Rung softly, the chime absorbs a spell if a 1D100 roll is 
made equal to or is less than the chime’s percentile rating. 
As the chime absorbs magic, its metal takes on a peculiar 
sheen and the chime’s tone alters in timbre. Once it has 
absorbed a spell, the chime retains the spell’s essence for 
2D6 minutes. During that interval, the holder may ring 
the chime loudly, allowing the held spell’s energy to be 
released violently back at its original caster, causing 1D6 
hit points damage for each 2 magic points cost of the spell 
absorbed. Using the chime in this fashion does not incur 
additional costs or rolls. Witnessing the reflection of spell 
energy may call for Sanity rolls.
Alternative names: The Minstrel’s Backlash, Harmonic 
Concordance, The Jester’s Bell.
