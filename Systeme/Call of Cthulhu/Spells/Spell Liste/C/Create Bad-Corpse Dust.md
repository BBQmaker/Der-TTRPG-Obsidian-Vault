Create Bad-Corpse Dust 2
• Cost:  2 magic points

 Cast
ing time: 6 hours
Creates a barrier that zombies cannot cross. This powder 
requires the intestines of a zombie, an ounce of flesh 
(which must be bitten out by the caster), and the dried and 
powdered flowers of a rare jungle liana (variations of the spell may call for alternatives). The ingredients are dried, 
pounded together, and chanted over for several hours, then 
poured in the desired trail or line. A final chant enacts the 
powder’s power. 
The dust creates a magical, invisible wall preventing 
zombies crossing. This barrier remains until the dust is 
washed or blown away. One such creation of the dust 
results in enough to form a barrier about 30 yards long.
Alternative names: Ward of the Dead, Line of Dust, The 
Flesh Barrier.
