Contact Child of The Sphinx 9
• Cost:  3 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1D6+4 rounds
Attracts a child of the Sphinx if within 20 miles of the
caster. The caster makes a small clay figurine in the shape
of any animal-headed man (requiring a successful Art/
Craft roll). The figurine can be reused for future castings.
To cast the spell, the caster burns a mixture of herbs underneath the figurine, bathing it in the smoke and intoning a chant. Once cast, any children of the Sphinx
within 20 miles will make their way to the caster, although
those children of the Sphinx bound to someone other than
the caster will be hostile to the caster.
