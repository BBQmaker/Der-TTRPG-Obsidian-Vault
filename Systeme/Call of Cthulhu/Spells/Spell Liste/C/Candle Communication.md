Candle Communication G
• Cost:  5+ magic points; 1 Sanity point

 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Allows two sentient beings to communicate magically by 
voice at a distance without other apparatus. This requires 
two casters. At an arranged time, each participant lights 
a candle and speaks the words of the spell over and over 
until the other’s voice can be heard. This spell works clearly 
at up to ten miles; for each additional hundred miles or 
fraction thereof an additional magic point must be spent by 
each of the casters. Maximum range is one thousand miles. 
Blowing-out the candle flame breaks communication. 
Deeper magic: up to four wizards may hold a simultaneous 
conversation, including being able to send images to one another. Such images appear in the candle’s flames.
Alternative names: Flame Tongue, The Breath of Flame, 
The Sorcerer’s Letter.
