Create Fetch Stick M
• Cost:  10 POW; 20 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 year
Enchants a spear-like weapon that can damage or kill 
extra-planar monsters. To make a fetch stick, the sorcerer 
first obtains a staff and attaches a sharpened iron point to 
one end. Over the course of the next year, the sorcerer then 
sacrifices two humans and 10 POW to the fetch stick, and 
attaches a skull to the other end of the stick. 
The process costs Sanity points and the Keeper should 
describe it gruesomely. An impaling blow from a fetch 
stick instantly destroys a zombie or other animated corpse.
Alternative names: Death Stick, Make Dead Man Bane, 
Enchant Spear.

Create Flesh Creeper 7
• Cost : 3 magic points; 5 POW; 1D10 Sanity points;
•
 Casting time:
 1 round
A star-shaped lump of raw flesh must be hacked from a 
living human for a flesh creeper to be created. The spell 
empowers the flesh to seek out a designated target. The 
caster must know the appearance of the target, and know 
his or her approximate location.
Once the target is found, the flesh creeper leaps onto his or 
her face and grafts instantly to the skin around the nose and 
mouth, sealing shut the airways (Sanity loss 0/1D4). Once in 
place, asphyxiation rules apply (see Other Forms of Damage, 
page 124, Call of Cthulhu Rulebook). After a victim dies, the 
creeper can detach and seek new prey until the caster’s POW 
in minutes have passed: then the flesh creeper dies.
