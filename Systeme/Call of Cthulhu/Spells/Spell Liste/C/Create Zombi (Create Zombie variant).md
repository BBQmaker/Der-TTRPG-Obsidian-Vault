 Cast
ing time: variable days
The target is brought to near death by a paralyzing powder 
made from blowfish innards and alkaloids. This poison 
must be inhaled. The target must then succeed in an Extreme CON roll to resist the poison; with a failure, 
the target falls into a deep trance indistinguishable from 
death. Horribly, the target is still conscious but incapable 
of movement as they are put in a coffin and buried alive. A 
small tube connects the coffin to the surface so that he or 
she may breathe. During this time, the unfortunate target 
of the spell must pass a Sanity roll every three game hours 
or lose 1D6 Sanity points. If the target goes insane during 
this period, he or she embraces the will of the sorcerer, 
grateful that the terrors of the grave have been dispelled.
Three nights later, the caster comes to the gravesite and 
casts the spell. If the caster perceives mental resistance 
from the target, an opposed POW roll is made between 
the caster and target. Whether the target is sane or insane, 
success with the spell drains away all but 1 POW of the 
target. If the spell fails, the caster may simply cover up the 
breathing hole and leave the victim to suffocate.
With a successful casting, the sorcerer has created 
a zombie servant, able to obey simple commands. The 
unfortunate zombi remains under the spell of the sorcerer, 
until such a time as the zombi is released—usually meaning 
the true death of the target or the death of its master.
