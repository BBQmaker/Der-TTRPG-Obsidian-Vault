 Cast
ing time: 2 hours
This ancient spell is used to bring doom upon an enemy. It 
is usually cast when the sorcerer wants the death to appear 
natural but be as torturous as possible.
The caster inscribes a parchment with ancient runic 
symbols. The parchment must be handed by the caster to 
the target in some manner, perhaps through trickery and deception. Using an intermediary will not work.
The enchanted parchment will try to destroy itself. 
When first discovered, and anytime it is handled, it will 
try to fly into a fire or out a window, unless the target or a nearby friend can make a successful DEX roll.
A few hours after the “gifting” occurs, the target will 
be alerted (via a demonic voice or vision in their mind) 
that they have two weeks before the End. After that, the 
target begins to feel watched. They will be ucomfortable if 
left alone, as they experience a growing sense that things 
are not right. Sleep becomes restless. Subtle things start 
occurring: doors open by themselves, elevators get stuck 
between floors, the lights go on and off, and so on. Gusts 
of warm air play around the target’s body. The anxiety 
grows into a brooding black depression. The events of the 
first week cause the target to lose 1 Sanity point per night. 
In the second week, the curse grows more powerful; 
for example, while getting into bed under the covers, the 
target’s hand may touch an inhuman fang-filled mouth; 
the target may glimpse a hideous demon reflected in glass, 
hear devilish music no one else can, etc. No one else will 
ever witness these events. The target will develop a worn, 
anxious appearance. Sanity rolls are made every night of 
the second week (1D2/1D4 loss). 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
In the last two days before the appointed time, the target 
is relieved of the feeling of being watched but feels that a 
doom still hovers over their head. During these last days, 
others seeing the target will often think they see another 
person standing nearby (like a dark shadow) although there 
is no one there. 
At midnight on the last day, a “demon” (extra-dimensional 
entity) will appear to destroy the target. If anyone else is 
around at that time, they will see a hazy form coming at 
the target. If they try to intervene, they too become targets 
for the demon. The demon will try to chase the target, or 
frighten them enough to cause a fatal accident of some 
kind. Otherwise they attack to kill psychically. 
The demon is a horrible hopping creature in white, with 
bat-like wings, horned head, snouted face, and glowing 
green eyes. It has INT 75, POW 150, and 30 magic points. 
Each time it attacks, it makes an opposed POW roll against 
its target, and if it succeeds, it drains 5D10 POW. If it 
loses the POW roll, the demon loses 1D6 magic points (on 
reaching zero it dissipates, but will return in 3D6 hours). 
The demon can be harmed by spells and enchanted weapons 
(any such damage is inflicted to POW instead of hit points). 
An Elder Sign (page 105) or Prinn’s Crux Ansata ( page 
153) can block it, but it will come back over and over until 
it is dealt with or the target is dead. Those who die appear 
as if they were frightened to death; a coroner will say the 
cause of death was a massive heart attack.
The only way to escape the demon is to pass the 
runic parchment back to the caster (intermediaries will 
not work). Since the caster will likely be on guard, it 
usually takes a clever plan to save the spell’s victim. If the 
parchment is destroyed, the curse remains and the target is 
doomed to be visited. To pass the parchment to someone 
else who is not the caster will not remove the curse on the 
original target and calls for a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss) for trying to hex another. Killing the caster will not stop the curse from occurring. If the runes are successfully passed 
back, the caster becomes the target of the demon at the 
appointed hour.
One theory speculates that if the target of the spell 
can learn the spell, they can attempt to reverse its effects 
and thereby dispel the demon. Whether such an approach 
would work is undetermined.
