Command of The Bloody Tongue 6
• Cost:  4 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
The caster makes an opposed POW roll against their 
designated target, who must be within visual and speaking 
range: if successful, the target finds that their mouth seals 
over in 3 rounds, replaced with a growth of flesh; calling 
for a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss). The spell causes no physical 
damage, but the speaker cannot talk or eat, although they 
can still breathe through their nose. 
Commonly, this spell is used on other sorcerers to diminish 
their powers or to silence prisoners. Knowledge of this spell 
allows the effects to be reversed (for the same cost). Surgery, 
or amateur surgery, with a knife has the same effect, but at 
the cost of hit points and possibly the target’s APP . 
Alternative names: Silence, Speak Not Thy Ill Lies.

Command Plants 8
• Cost : 2+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Enables the caster to control and manipulate plants, 
causing them to take on semi-sentient life. This spell may 
be used to cause vines to wrap around a target, branches 
to grasp at a target, roots to entangle feet, etc. The plants 
affected cannot actually move from their rooted ground. 
The spell costs 2 magic points per square yard of plant 
material to be controlled. The plants must be within the spellcaster’s sight, for the caster must point at them while 
intoning the spell. The Keeper should decide the STR and 
hit points of the plants in combat-type situations (corn 
stalks perhaps having 5 STR and 1 hit point each, thick 
tree roots having 50+ STR and 5 hit points each, etc.)
Alternative names: Burden of Growth, Bend Limb and Leaf 
to thy Will.
