Cast Circle 2
• Cost:  3+ magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 minutes
Creates a magical barrier through which specific unnatural 
creatures (byakhee, deep ones, lycanthropes, nightgaunts, 
vampires, wraiths, and zombies) may not pass.
 Other 
Mythos races (those which can be summoned and bound) 
have a 50% chance (by individual) of being stopped. 
Humans, natural creatures, and greater Mythos entities are 
unaffected. Likewise, spells, physical and magical weapons 
are unaffected.
The caster spends 3 magic points to establish the barrier, 
plus an additional magic point for each person to be 
encircled, while inscribing a circle on the floor; this circle 
glows brightly once the barrier is established. Though 
the barrier is inscribed as circular, nothing against which 
the spell is effective can reach those protected from any 
direction. Once cast, the magical barrier lasts for an hour, 
then must be recast to continue in effect.
Alternative names: Partition of H’Tan, The Elder Cordon.
