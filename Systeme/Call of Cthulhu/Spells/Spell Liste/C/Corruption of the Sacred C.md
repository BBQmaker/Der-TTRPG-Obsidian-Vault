Corruption of the Sacred C n
• Cost:  20 POW; 1D6 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 4 nights
The caster takes a personal item from the intended target 
of the spell and places it within a doll (the doll must be 
fashioned by the caster and can be made of straw, porcelain, 
wood, etc.). The caster is recommended to perform the 
spell “When spirits are the strongest,” (e.g. from midnight 
to two in the morning for four consecutive nights). Each 
night the caster forces iron nails into the doll and sacrifices 
5 POW. After four nights (expending a total of 20 POW 
and 1D6 Sanity), the spell takes effect.

On the fourth night, a “hungry ghost” (a malevolent 
non-corporeal entity) attaches itself to the target. The 
“ghost’s” insatiable desires constantly influence the hapless 
victim. Each night the target must make a Hard POW roll: 
failure costs him or her 5 POW and 1D4 Sanity points. 
The draining of POW and Sanity causes the target to give 
into their baser instincts (anger, envy, gluttony, greed, lust, 
pride, or sloth). The more the target is drained, the greater 
the manifestation of the baser instincts. The spell’s effect 
continues until the spell is broken (by the will of the caster 
or by their death), the target goes permanently insane, or 
another spell is used to dispel the “ghost” (such as Cast 
Out The Devil, page 62).
Deeper magic: wily sorcerers may be able to dictate the 
manner of their target’s behavior, compelling them to 
specifically “act up” in regards to a desired instinct, such 
as anger or gluttony.
