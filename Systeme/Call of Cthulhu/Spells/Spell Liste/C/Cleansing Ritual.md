Cleansing Ritual O
• Cost:  14 magic points; 5 POW; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Casting time:
 24 hours
A lengthy ritual designed to restore and bring comfort. 
From sunrise to sunrise, the caster chants over the target, 
while helpers pour freshly gathered water over the target at timed intervals. Between the bouts of water, the caster 
draws sigils of wellbeing on the target’s skin, repeating 
this throughout the ritual. 
After 24 hours, the target loses 5 POW and is restored 
to their natural state. Maledictions, such as curses and 
blights, are removed, while foreign objects, such as organs 
or appendages affixed by magic, fall off or can be cut away. 
The process is exhausting for the target, who normally 
spends the following 24 hours sleeping.
Note: not to be confused with the Ritual Of Cleansing (see 
Chaosium’s Horror on the Orient Express) which, while 
similar, is specifically attuned to the effects of the Sedefkar 
Simulacrum.
Alternative names: Restoration of the Flesh.
