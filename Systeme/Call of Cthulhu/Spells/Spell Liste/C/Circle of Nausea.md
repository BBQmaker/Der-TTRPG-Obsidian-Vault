Circle of Nausea 2
• Cost:  4 magic points; 2 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 minutes
Creates a powerful protective circle around the caster 
that causes nausea and pain in any human approaching 
it. The caster must draw a chalk circle on the ground and 
then fortify the circle with four enchanted opal stones—
one at each of the four cardinal points of the compass. 
Enchanting the stones requires the previous sacrifice of 
2 magic points into each (8 points total), which may be 
performed in advance of casting the spell. A further 4 
magic points are sacrificed when the spell in enacted.
Breaching the circle requires an opposed POW roll 
between the caster and the character wishing entry. Anyone 
who touches the circle and who fails the POW struggle 
vomits for the next five minutes or until he or she retreats 
at least 100 yards away. If anyone successfully breaches the 
circle, the spell collapses.
Alternative names:  Ward of Pulsating Efflugence, The Foetid 
Barrier.
