Contact spells are divided in to two separate groups: spells 
concerned with contacting Mythos creatures and monsters, 
and spells for contacting Mythos deities. The latter group 
is covered by the Contact Deity spells (page 72). 
Contact spells allow the caster to get in touch with 
intelligent monsters and alien races, perhaps to learn 
secrets of history, magic, and other dark matters. The caster 
should always have a definite goal in mind; bargains might 
be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.  Such spells 
do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell 
is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember 
Mythos entities are independent and intelligent beings 
with their own motivations (usually antithetical to 
humans)—casters make contact at their peril!

Contact spells are distinctly different from Summoning 
Spells ( page 174) that have the potential to allow casters 
to bind the summoned beings to their will. 
Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, 
though particular conditions or requirements may be 
unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting 
another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.
Cast properly, this spell always works—unless there 
are no such things living within a convenient distance 
(flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands 
to some part of Australia but ignore the chance to fly to 
North America). A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds 
to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in an 
hour or take a day or more to show up. For a random 
appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby 
will walk, swim, dig, or fly to the caster. If the trip is 
too long, the thing called simply never shows up. Things 
from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or 
evocative manner.
The spell brings a random member of the species, 
presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to 
be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order 
not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, 
it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer 
it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. 
If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only 
one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the 
Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a 
group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would 
rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact 
seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting 
results may emerge.
A range of Contact Monster spells follow; the list is 
not exhaustive. 
Alternatives names: use words like—Union, Commune, 
Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For 
example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.
