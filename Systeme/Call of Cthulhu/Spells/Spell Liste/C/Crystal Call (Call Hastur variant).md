Crystal Call (Call Hastur variant) 9
• Cost:  50+ POW; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ hours
The caster must be in possession of a specifically fashioned 
crystal, which acts as the spell’s catalyst. The crystal may be 
any jewel; it is the design of the jewel, the inter-relationship 
of the facets and angles, which creates the spell. In 
fashioning the crystal, the caster must temporarily expend 
50 POW to imbue the stone with its magical energy (POW 
is recovered after 6 days). Once the crystal is complete, it 
has a residue of magical energy that never dissipates.
When using the crystal as part of the calling rite, the 
caster focuses on the crystal and channels 25 POW into 
the rite while chanting the incantation; providing a base 
25% chance of calling Hastur. A drop of human blood 
must also be dripped onto the stone.
Note: also see Seal Pit (page 163).
