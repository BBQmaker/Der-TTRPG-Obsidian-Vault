Cast Out The Devil 8
• Cost:  10 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1 day
Frees the target of possession by alien entities. This 
elaborate and draining spell takes a full day to cast, 
requiring many components of tribal magic. For the spell 
to take effect, the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the possessing entity. Up to two willing assistants, 
who also know the spell, may spend 10 magic points to 
support the caster, adding a bonus die to the roll. This spell 
is seldom attempted without such help. 
Divergent forms of this spell exist in different cultures, 
such as African, Celtic, or Arabic societies. The material 
components required reflect the culture of the caster.
The spell may be used against many foes—to help a 
person possessed by Y’golonac or by a mind from the 
Great Race of Yith, as well as expel the brood of Eihort. 
If the creature that emerges from the victim is visible, all 
those present for the exorcism must make the appropriate 
Sanity roll.
Alternative names: The Rite of Exorcism, Compel the Demon, 
Soul Murder.
