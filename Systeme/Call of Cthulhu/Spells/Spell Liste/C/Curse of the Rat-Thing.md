Curse of the Rat-Thing 7
• Cost:  20 magic points, 5 POW; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day
When cast upon a corpse, dead within 24 hours, it causes 
the target’s spiritual essence to settle into the newly created 
body of a rat-thing. 
The disintegrating corpse forms the substance of the rat-
thing. The rat-thing’s face closely resembles a malevolent version 
of the target’s own face. As the Keeper wishes, being reborn as 
a rat-thing may cost a person’s total Sanity and perhaps force 
full-fledged membership in that evil species (considering the 
target was already dead, this seems highly likely).
Alternative names: Birthing of the Rat Familiar, 
Transformation of Two  into Four, Creation of the Rat Faced 
Servant.
