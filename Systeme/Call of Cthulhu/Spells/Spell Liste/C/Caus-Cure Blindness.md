# Cause/Cure Blindness
• Cost:  8 magic points; (plus 2D6 Sanity points for Cause Blindness)
• Casting time: 1 day

The target suffers complete and permanent blindness, as if by a stroke. The same spell can reverse blindness if the eyes and optic nerves are essentially intact. 
A day of ritual is required. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target (automatic success if the target is consenting).

Alternative names: Blindness, Grant Sight, Shade of Darkness, The Pharaoh’s Curse.
