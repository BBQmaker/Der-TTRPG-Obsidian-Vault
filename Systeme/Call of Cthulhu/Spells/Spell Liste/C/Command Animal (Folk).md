ing time: 1 round
The caster commands one animal of a specified species 
to obey a single command. Each version of this spell 
is specific to the creature called and commanded; thus, 
“Command Raven” would only concern members of the 
Corvus genus, and so on). Each such spell must be learned 
separately. Command spells for any natural animal may 
exist, including: Driver Ant Column, Green Mamba, 
Leopard, Raven, Serpent, Shark, and Spider Monkey. 
The command is answered naturally, the target animal 
moving by natural means towards the caster. The target is 
compelled to obey one order by the caster, even to attacking 
its own kind. Upon completion of the command the target 
is freed and cannot be compelled again for one day. The 
caster’s command must be simple, specific, visualized, and 
limited in duration. The target will begin to act in the 
round following the spellcasting. 
The caster must be able to see the animal and the 
command must be something that the creature could 
naturally accomplish and comprehend. “Protect me from 
harm forever,” would not be a valid command, but “slay that 
human,” would be. Orders might include carrying something 
somewhere, presiding at some ceremony, attacking, or going 
to a specific nearby location to appear as a warning.
The effect of the spell usually lasts until the caster’s 
command has been enacted. If some means of preventing 
the animal can be taken, for example shooting or 
incapacitating the animal, the spell’s effect fades. If no 
prevention is possible, the spell will diminish and end 
once the task is complete or over the course of 1D10+5 
minutes—whichever is sooner.
