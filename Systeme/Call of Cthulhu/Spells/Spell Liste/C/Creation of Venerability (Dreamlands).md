Creation of Venerability (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  12 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points 
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Grayish 
dust blows from the caster’s hands toward the target’s face. 
The caster makes an opposed POW roll versus the target 
of the spell: if the caster succeeds, the target ages horribly, 
losing 1D10 points each from STR, CON, and DEX, and 
aging 1D10 years. In addition, the target makes a Sanity 
roll each round they fail to resist the spell (0/1D6 loss). 
The spell may be maintained for as long as the caster has 
magic points to spend (each round after the first costs an 
additional 10 magic points and requires a new POW roll).
Quick-thinking people may avoid the worst of the spell 
by jumping into a nearby lake or river.
Alternative names: Life Leeching, The Grey Smoke of Doom.
