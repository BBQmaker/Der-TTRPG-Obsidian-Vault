An ancient Roman spell for creating an amulet against 
possession, suitable for a child. The wizard crafts a small 
container of gold (for those who can afford it), lead, or 
leather. Ox blood, moly (a herb), honey, milk, and hair 
from the chosen recipient of the spell are mixed together 
in the container; the spell is then cast over the course of 
the night. Once complete, the bulla is placed around the 
target’s neck within one hour. As long as the target wears 
the bulla, they cannot be possessed by outside “forces.”  
When a child turns 14 (thus becoming an adult in Roman 
society), the bulla is believed to lose its efficacy.Fear of possession by evil spirits often drove Roman 
families to commission bullae for their children. Usually, 
the bulla was gifted to the child on the ninth day after birth. 
Deeper magic: with the will and Mythos knowledge, 
a wizard may be able to fashion an amulet designed to 
protect an adult (possibly costing an increase in magic 
points or the sacrifice of POW).
Alternative names: none known.
