Cause/Cure Blindness C
• Cost:  8 magic points; (plus 2D6 Sanity points for Cause 
Blindness)
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day
The target suffers complete and permanent blindness, 
as if by a stroke. The same spell can reverse blindness if 
the eyes and optic nerves are essentially intact. A day of 
ritual is required. For the spell to take effect the caster 
must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target 
(automatic success if the target is consenting).
Alternative names: Blindness, Grant Sight, Shade of 
Darkness, The Pharaoh’s Curse.

Cause Disease C
• Cost : 8+ magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
Afflicts the target with a feverish illness resembling 
cholera, malaria, pneumonia, etc. For the spell to take effect 
an opposed POW roll must be made between the caster 
and target. If the target wins, there is no effect.
If the caster wins, symptoms such as high fever, nausea, 
vomiting, dehydration, and loss of concentration follow. 
The target loses 1D6 points of STR, CON, and DEX (roll 
separately for each) per day for a number of days equal to the 
number of magic points the caster has invested in the spell. If 
the target survives, he or she regains these points naturally over 
time. If any of the characteristics reach zero, the target dies.
To cast the spell, the attacker obtains some personal item of 
the target, especially something that has touched the mouth. 
The object is buried in a deep hole with shreds of poisonous 
plants. The hole is filled and a specially carved stone placed 
on top. A short chant follows and the spell is cast.
Bed rest is the only treatment that seems to maintain 
clarity of mind. Only curative magic truly helps. Retrieving 
the buried object and burning it and the poisonous plants 
breaks the spell, otherwise the spell runs its course.
Alternative names: Zura’s Gift, Ye Blighte of Woeful Humors, 
The Purple and Black Pox.
