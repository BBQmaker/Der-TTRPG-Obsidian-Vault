Call (The) Skinless One 9
• Cost:  up to 100 sacrifices
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day
Believed known only to the Brothers of the Skin, calling 
The Skinless One is an exceptional, major exercise. Each 
human sacrifice grants a +1  percentile to the chance of 
success. Exactly 100 magic points must also be expended. If 
the casting roll fails, The Skinless One may yet materialize 
to collect the sacrifices, and takes that number again from 
among the worshipers present. 
Note: see Horror on the Orient Express for further 
information about The Skinless One.
Alternative names: none known.

Call The Beast (Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
Summons a gigantic monster, an avatar of Nyarlathotep 
known as The Beast (but also by many other names), and 
may only be successfully cast in the vicinity of the Great 
Sphinx on the plateau of Giza, Egypt. The spell is believed 
to be known only to the Brotherhood of the Beast.
If successfully cast, the ground about the Sphinx quakes 
slightly, signifying that the Beast’s essence has entered the 
stone. The body flexes and the limbs begin to move with 
the sound of grinding stone. The face cracks and falls away, 
revealing a black, oval void in which can be seen whirling 
suns and galaxies. This entity is near mindless (in human 
terms) and immediately begins to destroy all those nearby, 
trampling men and buildings beneath its giant paws.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
The Beast.
Alternative names: Entreat Abu Hol, Grand Rite of the 
Father of Terror.

Call Yibb-Tstll 9
Traditionally cast by thirteen people and may only be cast 
at midnight on the first day of the year (but this may vary 
between calendars). The spell text recommends that seven 
of the summoners know the dismal spell, and that the 
Barrier Of Naach-Tith (page 83) is in place. 
Alternative names: Summon Forth the Sleeper of Kled, Beckon 
the Mother of Night.

Call Yig 9
This dangerous and obscure spell summons Yig, the Father 
of Serpents. The spell may only be cast in an area well 
suited to snakes, such as a desolate swamp, jungle, or desert. 
A number of snakes (or serpent folk) must be present at 
the site, with a total combined POW of at least 500. The 
spell, as described, makes no mention of human sacrifice. Casting this spell costs 1D10 SAN and 8 magic points. 
Alternative names: Petition the Father of Serpents, 
Supplication of Venom.

Call Yog-Sothoth 9
Calls the Outer God to a specially constructed stone 
tower. The tower must stand in an open area and the sky 
must be cloudless. The tower itself must be at least ten 
yards high. Each time the spell is cast, a human sacrifice 
is designated for the god’s taking—this need be no more 
than an invitation; gesturing toward a nearby village, for 
instance, from which Yog-Sothoth then selects a victim.The stone tower may be enchanted, lowering the magic 
points needed for a successful cast of the spell: each point 
of POW infused in the tower (permanently) grants +1 
percentile to the chance of a successful casting.
Alternative names: The Forbidden Song of the Key, The Yah-
Zek Channelling.
