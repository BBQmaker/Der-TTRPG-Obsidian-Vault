Contact Servitor of The Outer Gods 9
• Cost:  14 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1D6+4 rounds
A successful Luck roll establishes that a servitor is within the 
Milky Way galaxy when the spell is cast. Stars must be visible 
to the caster. He or she attempts to visualize Azathoth’s 
Ineffable Heart (reputedly a spheroidal symbol of meditation 
but actually of unknown shape) that pulses and shines like 
liquid flame. The servitor will expect a blood sacrifice. If the nominated sacrifice is inadequate, the servitor devours the 
caster. If the servitor accepts the sacrifice, it agrees to perform 
one simple task for the caster. Such tasks may include a 
question concerning Azathoth’s Court or another cosmic 
matter (a successful Persuade roll is required); the answer 
grants +1D3 points of Cthulhu Mythos to the questioner—
the answer is meaningless to onlookers. Alternatively, or 
in addition, the servitor may impart a spell directly to the 
caster’s brain if the Persuade roll is an Extreme success 
(causing the loss of 1D8 Sanity points and 1D10 rounds of 
disorientation). The servitor chooses the spell.
Its services rendered, the servitor may linger and play 
its unearthly pipes while colors flash across its body and 
its tentacles writhe, or it may dissolve and return to some 
galactic arm or stellar nursery to resume its previous 
activity. Hearing its insane and mesmerizing pipes provokes 
a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss) and, thereafter, its tune haunts every singer or instrumentalist who was present.
