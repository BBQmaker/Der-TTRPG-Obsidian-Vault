May be used to summon a storm. The storms are normal 
in nature and other than perhaps some heavy winds, rain, 
or snow, cause no direct damage. The rain or snow brought 
about by this spell can obscure vision and make driving or 
flying hazardous. The storm lasts for 10+1D100 minutes 
and will be localized in effect.
