ing time: 1 week
A ritual liquid must be poured over a corpse or into the 
grave where a corpse lies. The Keeper determines the ingredients of the liquid: at least one part should be 
difficult to obtain legally. The corpse is left to mature. At 
the end of a week, the caster comes to the grave and intones 
the binding ritual. At the end of the half-hour chant, the 
corpse claws its way from the grave and thereafter performs 
the caster’s will. The zombie will perform mundane and 
simple tasks such as “guard this,” “fetch that,” or “kill him!” 
A zombie created in this manner continues to rot after 
it has risen. Thus a wizard wishing a constant zombie 
servant must periodically create replacements.

The Ashen Cowl, Raising of the Dead.
