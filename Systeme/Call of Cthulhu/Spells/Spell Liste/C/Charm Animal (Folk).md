Charm Animal (Folk) 0
• Cost:  variable magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Causes a target animal to treat the caster as a friend. The 
spell costs 1 magic point for every SIZ 5 points of the 
animal, and lasts for 24 hours. After this time, the animal 
remembers nothing of its previous friendliness. The spell 
does not allow supernatural communication between the 
caster and the animal but, instead affects the animal’s behavior. The animal cannot be used to run errands 
or engage in combat, as these acts require complicated 
direction that the caster cannot impart. However, friendly 
animals will share their warmth during sleep, and those 
that are normally predators will share hunted game.

Touch.
