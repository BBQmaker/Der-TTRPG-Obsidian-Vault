Create Child of The Sphinx 7 
• Cost: 10+ magic points; 10 POW; 1D10 Sanity points
• Cast ing time: 1+ months
This ancient ritual allows the caster to create a Child of The 
Sphinx, a golem-like hybrid of human and animal resembling 
the animal-headed gods of ancient Egypt. The ritual is long 
and involved, requiring a host of magical components and 
a large workspace. Once the caster has obtained the head of 
an animal, the creation ritual may begin on a night of the 
new moon. The caster places the head into a consecrated vat 
filled with two gallons of Paut (see Brew Paut, page 49) and 
intones a lengthy chant, investing a number of magic points 
equal to one-fifth of the SIZ of the original animal. Once 
the chant is finished, the caster seals the vat and lights a fire s

Backstory
•
 Description: pale, haggard expression, 
overly long blond hair, with deep 
green eyes.
•
 Ideology: people are cattle, to be used 
and discarded in the service of the 
Old Ones.
•
 T
raits: spiteful, vindictive, repellent.
Born in Cornwall, England, as a child 
Locksby was always drawn to the darker 
side of life. Frequenting graveyards, 
ghoulishly devouring tales of murder and horror, and bullying others, she was ostracized from those of her age and took to wandering hidden paths and secret places. At some point, she 
became acquainted with a man, known 
locally as “Ragged Nick,” a wizard and 
priest in the service of the Horned Man (Nyarlathotep), who instructed 
Locksby in the secrets and mysteries of the Mythos.Learning all she could from the old 
man, Locksby eventually murdered Ragged Nick, fleeing with his books 
and magical devices to travel the world 
to seek out its darkest recesses and 
uncover lore that woman was not meant 
to know. Exactly where she traveled, who 
she met, and what she did is uncertain 
and shrouded in hearsay and foul rumor. 
What is known is that when Locksby 
had satiated her lust for knowledge in 
the Old World, she turned her attention 
to New World and came to reside in 
legend-haunted Dunwich. 
From those few seekers of Mythos 
wisdom with whom Locksby  
corresponds, little is fully known as to 
her intentions and plans. Not a member 
of any particular cult, but a friend to 
many cult leaders nevertheless, she has in 
recent times been seeking certain artifacts 
and a forgotten tome known only as “The Severance Aphopsis.” Her epistles 
to contacts worldwide clearly show her 
great desire to locate the tome as it, in her 
own words, “Will give me the last Aklo 
formula to begin the Great Work.” As to 
what the “Great Work” may be, and its 
possible consequences, one can be sure it 
will not be beneficial for humanity.

beneath it. For the next lunar month, the caster leaves the 
mixture to bubble and percolate. The caster must change the 
Paut halfway through the process.
On the night of the next new moon, the caster removes 
the head from the vat. By this time, the head has grown or 
contracted until it is proportional to a human body. The body 
donor, who must be alive, is given a powerful mixture of 
Paut and rare herbs to drink, which causes a deep enchanted 
slumber. The caster then chants over the body and paints 
inscriptions on the skin with Paut ink, as well as sacrificing 10 
magic points and 5 POW to hold the body’s life in suspension. 
Once the chant is finished, the caster decapitates the body and 
sews on the animal head using gold thread—this portion of 
the ritual requires a successful Medicine roll (failure may mean 
the spell works but the created Child is somehow “wrong”). 
Once the new head is attached, the caster sacrifices a further 
5 POW to awaken the head and give it dominion over the 
new body. The result is a Child of The Sphinx. 
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
children of the Sphinx.

Create Curse Tablet M
• Cost : 20 magic points; 1D2 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 24+ hours
The sorcerer must have access to a lead tablet, which they 
inscribe with the desired curse and then bury (usually 
in an underground chamber or tomb). Merely burying 
the thing in a hole in the ground is insufficient; an 
existing subterranean structure must be used. The curse 
is traditionally written in either Greek or Oscan. After 
they bury the tablet, the sorcerer makes an opposed POW 
roll against the curse’s intended target (the sorcerer may 
permanently sacrifice 30 POW to ensure success). If the 
caster is successful, the target suffers the effects of the 
curse; if unsuccessful, the curse has no effect.
The nature of the curse must involve fortune or money. 
A curse cannot kill someone outright, but may “damage” 
his or her business, livelihood, and relationships.
The curse is permanent unless the tablet is removed from 
its burial place. The instant it’s removed, the curse is lifted. 
The target doesn’t have to be the one to remove the tablet; 
anyone can do it, even unwittingly. To re-enact the curse, the 
spell’s costs must be again be spent, while the tablet is reburied.

Treasures Transformed to Spit.
Create Curse Whistle M
• Cost : 30 magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 or more nights
Creates magical musical pipes from the bones of an owl 
(some variations call for human bone). The creator must 
expend magic points over the course of one or more nights 
from the first full moon following the Summer Solstice. 
The caster may be assisted with the expenditure of magic 
points by others who also know the spell. The finished 
whistle can be used to cast the spells of Soul Singing (page 
171) and Pipes Of Madness ( page 150), and possibly others. 
Alternative names: Cry of the Bone Owl, Make Hoot Pipe, 
Instrument of Doom.
