Should be cast at the edge of a saltwater ocean or sea. To 
work best, it should be cast near a deep one city, such as 
the waters off Innsmouth, Massachusetts, or the coast near 
the lost town of Dunwich by the Sea, England. Part of 
the ritual consists of throwing specially inscribed stones 
or jewelry into the water.
