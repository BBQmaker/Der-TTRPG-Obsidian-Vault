 Cast
ing time: 1D6+4 rounds
The best place to cast this spell is at a temple to 
Tsathoggua, whose altar statue of the Great Old One is still 
present, or at a spot near an opening into the black abyss of 
N’Kai, somewhere near Binger, Oklahoma. Possibly other 
places in North America offer entry and exit points. One 
such cavern reputedly exists near Dunwich, Massachusetts.
