Control Elements b
• Cost:  8+ magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 10 minutes
A powerful spell enabling the control of earth, wind, fire, or 
water. The spell’s effects might cause the ground to shake or 
split open, winds to grow strong and destructive, fire to rapidly 
spread, or water to form deadly waves or whirlpools, etc.
While the spell is the same for each of the four 
elements, with just a minor alteration specific to each of 
the elements, it must be cast separately for each element 
the caster wishes to control. 
For every 8 magic points invested, the spell’s radius of 
effect increases by 10 yards. The caster must be holding a 
sample or piece of the element that they desire to control. The starting Strength of the element, with a basic casting of 
the spell, is STR 125. An additional 10 STR can be added 
for each additional magic point (above 8) expended at the 
time of casting. The spell’s effects last for 1D10 +5 minutes.
The element inflicts damage equal to its damage bonus each 
round to all (except the caster) within the radius of effect. The 
damage bonus for the element is calculated solely from its STR, 
as it does not inherently have any SIZ, e.g. a column of water 
with 125 STR can inflict 1D4 damage per round; a fire of STR 
165 inflicts 1D6 damage per round, etc. Naturally, the stronger 
the force, the greater its effects upon the local environment.
