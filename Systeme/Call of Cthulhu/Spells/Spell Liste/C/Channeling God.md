hours of chanting are conducted while working upon the 
creation of the vessel, at the climax of which, the caster 
makes a relevant Arts/Craft roll, aiming to achieve an 
Extreme success. Any other degree of success or failure 
means the vessel is not of a quality good enough for the 
rite. Attempts to repeat the ritual require the creation a 
new piece of art and repaying the spell’s cost.
If successful, the vessel is entered by a Muse from 
Beyond and consequently transforms into a Manifestation 
of Inspiration.
Note: see Nameless Horrors for further information about 
the Muse from Beyond and Manifestations of Inspiration.
Alternative names: none known.
