The caster prepares a sauce during the hours of the moon, 
made from pounded human ganglia and other diverse ingredients. The sauce tastes something like creamed

spell effects remain (a successful Hard POW roll resists 
the urge can cancels the Sanity loss). Such unfortunates 
may seek easy meat by visiting the local morgue or could be driven to get fresher meat by attacking passersby.
