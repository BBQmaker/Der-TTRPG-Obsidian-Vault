Curse of the Stone 6
• Cost:  9 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Causes horrible hallucinations in the mind of the target. 
An ensorcelled stone tablet is required; one could be enchanted for the purposes of this spell by chiseling a 
sigil into a small stone slab and sacrificing 4 magic points, 
or an Enchanted Stone Tablet (page 111) may be used.
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Either the caster or the target of the spell must hold the 
tablet, and the target must be visible to the caster. For the spell 
to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW 
roll with the target. The spell being successful, the target is 
instantly overwhelmed with dreadful hallucinations, losing 
1D4 Sanity points and continues to be blinded and misled by 
phantoms each round until they make a successful POW roll 
(the round following the spell taking effect). Once the target 
has made a successful POW roll he or she continues to be 
plagued by nightmares (costing 1 Sanity point per night). To 
lift the curse, the target needs ingenuity—either killing the 
caster or getting him or her to repeal the spell.
Alternative names: Bring Forth Ungodly Nightmares, 
Demons of  the Mind, Ye Phantom’s Bite.
