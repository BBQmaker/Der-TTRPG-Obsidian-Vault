ing time: 3 minutes, 3 times a day
There are numerous versions of the chant, the most well-
known is used by certain American Indian tribes of the 
southwest. Properly performed, the chant protects the 
caster and his or her domicile from both Yig and the 
children of Yig.
The chant must be repeated thrice daily. Once at 
sunrise or upon awakening, once at midday, and again at 
sunset or before retiring. The chant must be recited for 
approximately three minutes and 4 magic points expended 
each time. The individual will be protected from direct 
harm caused by Yig or his sacred serpents. This spell 
affords no protection from normal snakes, serpent folk, 
or from large natural disaster effects (such as those caused 
by Yig’s will).
Alternative names:  Song of Yig, Cantu Protegentibus, Song 
of Zenqaba.
