Command Shoggoth 8
• Cost:  2 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Compels a shoggoth within 1–2 miles to approach the caster 
and obey a single specific command, which it will perform for 
up to 1D10 hours. The spell may be cast as often as the caster 
can afford. However, each time the spell is cast on the same 
shoggoth, the monster grows more resentful and the magic 
point and Sanity cost doubles. The shoggoth must be able to 
comprehend the command, so the instructions must be simple 
and apt: “smash that wall and then return to whence you came” 
works fine, but “pick six bouquets of lilies” would be alien to a 
shoggoth, who would begin to suspect it was being exploited.

Compel Flesh B 7
• Cost : 5+ magic points; 3 Sanity points.
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The caster targets an individual who becomes a living zombie, 
capable only of following simple spoken instructions. Costs 
5 magic points plus an additional magic point for every ten 
game rounds that the spell remains in effect. The soul of the 
target must be bound (see Bind Soul, page 41), allowing 
the caster to use this spell to force the body of the target to 
perform actions. The body will follow instructions until a task 
is completed, the body is killed, or the spell ends.
