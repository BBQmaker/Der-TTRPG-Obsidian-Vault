Curse of the Putrid Husk C
• Cost:  5 magic points; 10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Brings sanity wracking illusions to the target of the spell. 
The target perceives that his or her skin is visibly rotting and 
corrupting. The outward appearance seems to deteriorate 
swiftly, so that great rents and tears occur through which 
internal organs begin to tumble out (with the target losing 
1D10 Sanity points in the process). Thereupon the target 
faints and awakens in a few minutes, whole and normal. For the spell to take effect an opposed INT roll must be 
made between the caster and target—impose one penalty die 
on the target if the spell is cast at night while the target is 
sleeping. The entire cycle of effect takes about twenty minutes. 
Note that repeated applications can drive a target insane.
The caster must know the target, and the caster must 
have a personal object belonging to the target as a focus. 
The experience of the spell is devastating; however, successful Psychoanalysis can help the victim come to 
terms with these inexplicable dreams and hallucinations 
and restore half of the Sanity loss. 
Deeper magic: as described, the illusory effect of the spell 
is apparent only to the target. For an extra 5 magic points, 
the illusion of the spell affects everyone; observers should 
make a Sanity roll (0/1D6 loss). For the cost of 20 magic 
points, 25 POW, and 20 Sanity points the caster can make 
the spell actually physically happen: each round the target 
also suffers 1D6 damage until death or until the caster is somehow prevented from continuing the spell.
