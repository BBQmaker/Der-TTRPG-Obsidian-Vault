 Cast
ing time: 4 rounds
Creates a misty veil that blocks out extraterrestrial light and 
limits visibility. By making an appeal to Apophis (or Apep), the 
Egyptian Serpent of Chaos, the caster can blot out sunlight, 
moonlight, or starlight in a 100-yard radius. Spells or rituals 
requiring any such celestial bodies to be visible are unable 
to be completed until the mist clears. The spell lasts for 30 
minutes. Visibility is reduced to 10 feet during the day, or 
to total darkness at night, unless an artificial light source is 
present. No other weather-related phenomena, such as wind, 
temperature, or precipitation, are affected by this spell.
Alternative names: The Blinding Smoke, The Impenetrable 
Cloud of Despair.
