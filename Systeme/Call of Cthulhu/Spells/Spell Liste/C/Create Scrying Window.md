Enchants a piece of glass to create a permanent magic window 
that allows the sorcerer to look into the past. Using the glass 
costs the viewer 1D3 Sanity points per session, as well as 
incidental Sanity losses for viewing particular monsters.
To make a scrying window, the sorcerer must enchant 
a clear viewing glass with 50 POW. When the glass is 
enchanted, it must be keyed to a specific time in the past, 
relative to the date the glass is made. As a key, one could 
say, “800 years past,” but not “1125 BCE”. After the glass 
is enchanted and keyed, 98 pieces of expensive colored 
glass must be enchanted, requiring 1 magic point each, 
and fitted carefully into a geometric mosaic with the clear 
viewing glass at the center. When finished, the central 
glass shows the site at which it is placed (though at the 
appropriate time in the past). 
The viewing site may be changed by expending 1 magic 
point and five minutes of concentration per 100 miles or 
fraction thereof moved.
The glass has obvious limitations: a given scene can be 
viewed once, for time passes on both sides of the glass, and 
the glass must be tuned to a spot where things actually happen.
The scrying window has an inherent danger. Any 
intelligent being viewed may make a Hard POW roll to 
realize that it is being observed. So notified, the being (if 
able) could then cast a spell through the window, including 
a Summon or Call spell which could manifest a monster 
on the observer’s side of the window!
