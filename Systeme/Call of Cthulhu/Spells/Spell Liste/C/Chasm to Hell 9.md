Chasm to Hell 9 C
• Cost:  15 POW; 2D6 Sanity points
•
 Casting time:
 1 round
The caster shouts aloud a curse (divergent forms of the 
spell call for differing curses; in Japan, for example, the 
caster damns the target to one of the Hells of Jigoku). In 
response, an earthquake rocks the area and a fissure opens 
in the earth below the target, sucking the named target 
down to their death.
It is written that those who look down the chasm will 
see sights not meant to be seen (Sanity roll, 1/1D6 loss), believing the viewer is looking upon hell itself.
Depending on the circumstances, the Keeper may allow 
the target to make a DEX or Jump roll to avoid falling 
into the fissure but, note that, after 1D4 minutes, 1D4 
creatures from beyond will ascend and attempt to grab 
the target in order to drag them down. The nature of the 
creatures appearing largely depends upon the culture of 
the caster and the target: they see “demons” appropriate to 
their cultural reference. In reality, such entities are Mythos 
in nature, allowing the Keeper to use whatever suitable 
Mythos monster they see fit.
