 Cast
ing time: 10 minutes
Creates a way to view scenes from the past. Costs each 
viewer 1D6 Sanity points, plus any Sanity loss for what 
is viewed. A scrying device, such as a crystal ball, and an 
enchanted brazier are required. Unless the vision comes 
under the sway of a Great Old One (20% chance), the 
scene viewed is of the caster’s choice and described with 
the Keeper’s discretion. A Great Old One might cause 
visions to appear that were pertinent to itself or some 
artifact, instead of what was desired by the caster.
Alternative names: Visions of Things That Were, Shadows 
of the Past.
