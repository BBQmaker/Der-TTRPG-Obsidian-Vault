CALL DEITY SPELLS
• Cost: 1+ magic points per person; 1D10 Sanity points 
(caster only)
•
 Cast
ing time: 1–100 minutes
Call Deity spells bring the avatar, Outer God, or Great Old One 
before the caster. Casting this type of spell is perilous indeed, 
even for cultists. Only cult priests or desperate people should 
choose to call a Mythos deity. A handful of examples are cited 
here, however both Call and Dismiss spells are likely to exist 
for every Great Old One and for every form of Mythos god.
A group can assist by adding power to Call spells, with 
the caster acting as the focus for the group. Everyone 
present expends 1 magic point. Those who know the 
spell can sacrifice any number of magic points (including 
“burning” hit points). The total of the magic points spent is 
the percentage chance that the spell works. For each magic 
point spent, the group must chant for a minute, but never 
for more than 100 minutes. On a roll of 100 the spell will 
always fail, with all magic points sacrificed lost.
The caster also loses 1D10 Sanity points in casting 
the spell. All present must make a Sanity roll if the 
deity appears. The Keeper should contrive some form of 
motivation for the summoned being’s behavior, attitude, and 
propensity to meaningfully interact with those who called 
it forth. Mostly, when a Mythos deity arrives on Earth, it wants to stay and is usually hungry and demanding.Opposite: Burden of the Skinless One, a Byzantine Mural by Juan Barbas

While many Call Deity spells include a dismissal 
component, providing instruction for returning the deity 
back from whence it was summoned, there are countless 
times when a Call Deity spell does not include the necessary 
dismissal. Incomplete spell transcriptions, lack of knowledge, 
and evil intent on the part of the transcriber are all possible 
reasons why the dismissal elements could be missing.
Each deity requires certain conditions to be in place 
for the Call spell to work. Keepers should use these 
as inspiration but not be constrained by them for two 
reasons. The first reason is fiction based; no human fully 
understands the Cthulhu Mythos so there may be more 
than one way to call a deity. The second reason is that 
experienced players will quickly latch onto the familiar 
elements and the mystery will be blown.
Note: also see Dismiss Deity Spells (page 96).
A range of Call Deity spells follow; the list is not 
exhaustive. All spells (unless noted) have the same base 
cost as described above.
Call Aku-Shin Kage (Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
This Japanese spell brings forth an avatar of Nyarlathotep, 
Aku-Shin Kage, to a specially prepared suit of o-yoroi 
armor (as worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan). 
The suit of armor must be painted with the blood (SIZ 
200 total) of sentient beings and the last owner of the armor 
must have died wearing it. The caster then invokes the spell 
on a moonless night. If the avatar arrives, a shadow, black 
as pitch, creeps over the entire area, blinding everyone. 
The shadow coalesces and inhabits the armor (causing the 
armor to blacken); blood constantly drips from cracks in 
the armor. This is now the embodiment of Aku-Shin Kage.
Alternative names: none known.

Call Ahtu (Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
Ahtu is an avatar of Nyarlathotep, worshipped mainly by 
central and eastern Africa cults (who refer to him as the 
Spiraling Worm). Ahtu appears in the form of a black 
column of viscous matter, fifty feet in diameter, erupting 
from below ground. Ahtu can be called only at certain 
specific locations in Africa.
A special amulet depicting a three-lobed eye wreathed 
by flames is necessary for the spell, as is a performance of 
self-mutilation by the caster. It is worth noting that the amulet would normally be comprised of two pieces, kept 
apart, so as to not accidentally arouse Ahtu. 
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about Ahtu.
Alternative names: Call Spiraling Worm.

Call Arwassa 9
Brings forth Arwassa, a little-known Great Old One, on 
the first night of the new moon. Appearing, the fearsome 
Arwassa must be fed a total of SIZ 500 living creatures, 
including at least one human being. Since Arwassa’s 
worshipers always provide sufficient fodder—what would 
happen if they fail is unknown.  
Arwassa appears as a headless giant humanoid, with four 
enormous tentacles in place of limbs. The neck opens into 
a giant toothless maw, eight feet across, which continually 
gapes and contracts, as if screaming.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Arwassa.Alternative names: Unite the Headless One.

Call Avatar of The Skinless One
