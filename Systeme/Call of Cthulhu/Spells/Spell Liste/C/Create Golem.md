ing time: 1D6+4 days
Fashions and brings to life an artificial being made of clay. A 
golem can be a trusted helpmate and defender for its creator, 
but there is always a chance of the construct becoming 
uncontrollable, since it inevitably broods on its captivity. 
Golems cannot speak and can only understand commands 
of a number of words equal to one-fifth of its INT. 
Once the golem has been constructed, a single word gives 
the golem its life force. The word is inscribed on its forehead, 
on a clay tablet, or piece of parchment placed under its tongue 
(the word is usually unique to the culture of the caster and the 
spell variant). Creation of the golem requires at least one week, a 
successful Art/Craft (Sculpture) roll, and the necessary spell cost.
While under its caster’s control, a golem can be made either 
active or dormant with the single command word (chosen by 
the caster). A golem increases by 5 SIZ and 5 STR points 
for each full 24 hours it is active. When the golem’s SIZ 
exceeds the caster’s POW, every day thereafter the creator must 
overcome the creature’s SIZ with their POW in an opposed 
roll, or the golem leaves the caster’s control—active or not. 
Usually resentful of captivity, once freedom is attained, golems 
tend to embark on an indiscriminate destructive rampage.
Destroying the source of the word (on its forehead, on 
the tablet, parchment, etc.) causes the golem’s destruction.
