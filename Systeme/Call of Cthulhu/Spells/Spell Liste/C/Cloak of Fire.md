 Cloak of Fire 6
• Cost:  12 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
At great pain to the caster, this spell increases the caster’s 
movement and augments his or her combat defense. Only 
the caster may benefit from the spell. It takes one round 
to cast and its effect lasts 4D4 rounds. Viewing the cloak 
in action costs 1/1D3 Sanity points.
The spell wreathes the caster in weaving, glittering 
points of light, each spark dragging a luminous trail 
and flickering white-hot. Sealed within the cloak, the caster rises several inches off the floor. Nonetheless, 
body movements are precise. The nimbus of the cloak is 
agonizing, costing 1D6 Sanity points to the caster. 
While the spell is in effect, double the caster’s MOV and 
grant a bonus die to DEX rolls (including Dodge rolls). 
Impose one penalty die to all attacks against the caster. 
Anyone attacking with unarmed attacks (fist, kick) suffers 
1D6 damage for each such attack.
If the caster touches someone, treat it as a melee attack 
using the caster’s Fighting (Brawl) skill, causing 1D6 
damage (plus a Luck roll to see if the target has avoided 
catching fire); each time this happens, the caster also 
suffers half of that rolled damage (round down) as his or 
her skin flashes away to feed the cloak’s magical surface. 
It is possible that this spell could lower the caster’s hit 
points enough to cause death.
Deeper magic: the caster may expend an additional 6 
magic points per round to unleash a tentacle of flame at a 
designated target. This is a melee attack and is made with 
one bonus die. The target may attempt to Dodge or fight 
back. The fiery assault delivers 1D8 damage (plus Luck 
roll to avoid catching fire), melting flesh in horrific ways.
