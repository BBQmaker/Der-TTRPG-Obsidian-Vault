Call Zombie 9
• Cost:  2 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 4 rounds
Calls all zombies within a mile of the caster to gather at 
the caster’s location. After sunset, the caster inscribes a 
circle on the ground, stands in its center and chants. The 
circle protects the caster (and any others admitted before 
the chant is begun) from the undead as long as they remain 
within. The circle may hold no more than four people. 
Like moths to a candle, the zombies are drawn to the 
circle but must stop at its edge, staring hungrily at those 
inside. The zombies are held at the circle’s edge until dawn, 
unable to withdraw, even if attacked.
Alternative names: Summon the Dead, Petition of the 
Graveless Ones.
