Circle of Warding 2
• Cost:  variable magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ hours
Casting this spell takes an hour per magic point expended. 
The caster draws a geometric diagram on the ground. 
When a summoned being attempts to cross the barrier, it 
must make an opposed POW roll against the total magic 
points invested in the circle (multiplied by five) or be 
unable to physically cross or disrupt it. The spell ends 
when a non-summoned creature passes in or out of the 
circle, or at the next sunrise or sunset. 
Alternative names: The Elder Geometry.

CIRCLE SPELL VARIATIONS
Circles of protection may take many forms, each causing undue 
effects on those attempting to breach the perimeter. The basic 
process requires the description of a circle, with variations in the 
materials used (e.g. stones, chalk, sage smudge-sticks, vervain, 
etc.). In most cases, the person or entity trying to break through 
the protection suffers some form of pain or discomfort, repelling 
them from entering the circle. More extreme forms of circle 
spells may require greater costs (increased magic points, sacrifice 
of POW) if the target is to suffer the loss of hit points.
