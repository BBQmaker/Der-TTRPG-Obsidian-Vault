Clutch of Nyogtha 6
• Cost:  1+ magic points; 1D20 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
The caster must spend 1 magic point to begin the spell; 
the target must be within conversational distance. For the 
spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed 
POW roll with the target. If the caster wins the roll, the 
target feels as though a large hand or tentacle is crushing 
his or her heart, causing 1D3 damage each round that 
the spell is in effect. While under such attack, the target 
is temporarily paralyzed, as though having a heart attack. 
In the round that the accumulated damage from this spell 
reduces hit points to zero, the target’s chest ruptures and 
bursts, and the target’s smoking heart appears in the hand 
of the caster.
The caster must concentrate on the spell each round to 
maintain its effect. Each round the spell lasts, the caster 
must spend magic points equal to twice the number of hit 
points caused in damage during the last round, and must 
win an opposed POW roll with the target. If the caster is 
distracted, the spell ends. 
Alternative names: The Vile Wrench, The Insidious Wrath 
of the Dark Wizard, Ye Loathsome Tickle.
