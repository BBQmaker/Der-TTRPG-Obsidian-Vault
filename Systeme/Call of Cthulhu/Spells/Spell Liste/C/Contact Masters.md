 Cast
ing time: 1D6+4 rounds
Alleged to establish contact with one or more of the Ascended 
Masters, who supposedly watch the world from the city of 
Shamballah, hidden in the mountains of Tibet. Whether the 
spell actually does what it says or, in fact, puts the caster in 
contact with some other Mythos intellect is undecided.
SHAMBALLAH
Shamballah, known to the outside world as the home of the 
Ascended Masters, is described as having been established by 
wizard priests and sorcerers fleeing Lemuria, Atlantis, and Mu. 
Tales speak of the K’n-yan peoples settling in the underground 
tunnels beneath the community, along with denizens of 
Yaddith. This quasi-mythical place exists simultaneously in 
Tibet, the Dreamlands, and on the burned remnants of an 
unnamed alien planet. 
It is believed that the supply of Liao, the Plutonian Drug, 
comes from the Shamballah valley where vast fields of black 
lotus are grown and harvested. Liao is the root of much 
trade between Shamballah and the Plateau of Leng, which is 
said to be easily accessible via tunnels and secret passes. The 
tcho-tchos, barely tolerated by the Shamballah community, 
act as traders, but they do serve to save the inhabitants the 
inconvenience of traveling into the outside world. Such tcho-
tcho are often mistaken as members of Tibetan Sherpa peoples 
by travelers in the Himalayan region.
