This spell is favored by serpent folk and allows the caster to 
assume the living likeness of a person freshly dead, as seen 
by eye, video camera, photograph, etc. The target may be no 
more than 15 SIZ points different from the caster. The caster 
consumes the target (normally over a number of days) and 
works the spell, expending 10 magic points every six hours 
and permanently sacrificing 5 POW points. Once complete, 
the caster takes on the appearance of the target at will, for 
as long as desired. To the keen observer, the shadow of the 
caster remains that of his or her original form (not that of the 
consumed). Similarly, the caster’s skills and memories remain 
intact—the victim’s are gone. The caster could consume several 
likenesses and thereby take on several guises at will.
Upon losing one or more hit points, the caster’s original 
form is resumed. To go from the assumed to the original 
form takes 20 seconds. The original form must be reverted 
to before another form can be assumed. To go from the 
original to an assumed form takes 1D3 minutes. 
Deeper magic: some spellcasters are able to recollect 
memories and thoughts of those who have been consumed. 
This is usually a specific piece of information that was known 
to the unfortunate target of the spell. An additional magic point must be spent together with a roll under the caster’s 
POW for each additional piece of information sought.
