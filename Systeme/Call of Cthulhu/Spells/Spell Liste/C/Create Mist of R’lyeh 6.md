Flesh creepers attach to the victim’s face and attempt to seal 
their airways. Once affixed, they maintain their grip and 
asphyxiate the victim.
Asphyxiation: a CON roll should be made each round; once a 
CON roll is failed, damage is sustained each round thereafter 
until death or until the victim is able to breathe.
Seal Mouth  90% (45/18),  damage asphyxiation,  
  1D6 per r ound. 
Armor: must either be cut off or reduced to zero hit points—
divide the damage from successful attacks between the creeper 
and its victim.
Skills: Find Designated Target 99%, Leap Onto Face 75%.
Sanity Loss:  1/1D4 Sanity points to see a flesh creeper. Having 
one stuck onto your face costs a further 0/1D4 Sanity Points.
