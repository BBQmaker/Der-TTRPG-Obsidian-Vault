Create Barrier of Naach-Tith 2
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 minute
This barrier provides both a physical and magical defense. 
Each participant in this spell loses 1D10 Sanity points and a 
variable number of magic points: each magic point expended 
in the creation provides the barrier 3D10 points of STR. The 
spell takes 1 minute to cast (during which time all magic 
points to be used must be expended) and the resulting 
barrier lasts 1D4+4 hours. Anyone who knows the spell 
may participate in the casting and contribute magic points.
The barrier is spherical in shape and about 100 yards 
in diameter. It may be directed around the caster (like a 
bubble) to protect from harm, or it can be cast to encompass 
a monster or enemy. Any creature bisected by the barrier’s 
boundary upon its creation is unharmed and thrust outside 
the barrier. Anything trapped within should be allowed 
a STR roll opposed by the STR of the barrier; however, 
if more than one creature is trapped, multiple strengths 
cannot be combined to escape. A bullet or missile can cross 
the barrier if the rolled damage (ignore impales) to the 
barrier is greater than one-fifth of the barrier’s STR. If 
penetrating the barrier, the object inflicts the damage rolled, 
as if the barrier did not exist, and the barrier is destroyed.
A written copy of this spell is known to be in a great 
haunted library on a planet orbiting the star Celaeno.
Deeper magic: those harnessing the knowledge and power 
of the Mythos are able to increase the size of the barrier 
to 200 yards in diameter.

Sphere that Entraps the Demon.
