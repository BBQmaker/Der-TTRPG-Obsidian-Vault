of Chaugnar Faugn. The spell works regardless of distance; 
the caster must win an opposed POW roll with the target 
(each week of casting beyond the second grants a bonus 
die to the caster).
The first night (following the first week of chanting) and 
for each night thereafter, the target’s dreams are filled with 
horrible visions sent by Chaugnar Faugn. Soon he or she 
suffers from trance states in which physical attempts are 
made to reach the god and be accepted as a living sacrifice. 
These trances become longer and more frequent until the 
target succeeds. That interval might be one-fifth of the 
target’s POW in days; however, a strong-willed individual 
may fight-off the effects for a number of days up to the value 
of their POW (Hard POW roll). Eventually the target will 
find some way to become a sacrifice and will be  devoured—
the flesh fragment possessed by the caster instantly rots, 
demonstrating that the spell has concluded successfully.
