A rare but potent incantation used in conjunction with 
a specially designed piece of music. The spell causes the 
effects of the recorded music to retain the same potency of 
a live performance by creating a reservoir of magic points, 
which are utilized when the recording is played back. 
A group of people can support the enchantment.  Those 
who also know the spell may invest as many magic points 
as desired. Others, who do not know the spell, may invest 
only 1 magic point each. The total of the magic points 
invested to enchant the recording is the amount available 
each time it is played to aid in the casting of other spells. 
The enchanted recording may support with casting other 
song-spells, such as the Song of Hastur (page 169 or Soul 
Singing (page 171).
