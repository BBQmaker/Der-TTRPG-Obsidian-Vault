Control Skin n
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 30 minutes
For purposes of disguise, the caster may meld, bend, and 
alter the skin of one general body area per casting. General 
body areas are: head, torso, right arm, left arm, right leg, 
and left leg. The caster may cast the spell upon themselves 
or upon another—in which case, for the spell to take effect, 
the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the 
target, unless the target is willing. 
To change a single body area takes about thirty minutes to 
prepare and enact, with the effect lasting approximately one 
hour. For permanent change, it costs the caster 5 POW per 
body area. A second casting of the spell can undo the change. 
Deeper magic: the Brothers of the Skin, a sinister cult 
operating in Eastern Europe, are accomplished masters in 
the use of this spell. Cult members are able to change entire 
bodies at a cost of 30 magic points and 6D6 Sanity points.
Alternative names: Skin Walking, Meld Flesh, Meat Sculpting.
