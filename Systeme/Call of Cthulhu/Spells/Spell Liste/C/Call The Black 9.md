 Cast
ing time: 3 hours
The sorcerer summons the living blood of Yibb-Tstll, 
known as “The Black,” against a single target. The blood appears as soft dark flakes that adhere to the body of the 
target, accumulating in great mass, causing suffocation 
and death.
The first round that the target is covered in The Black, 
he or she must make a CON roll; with success, the target 
loses 1D2 hit points, whereas a failure means a loss of 
1D4 hit points. On the second round a Hard CON roll 
is required (1D4/1D6 hit point loss). On the third and 
subsequent rounds the target must succeed in an Extreme 
CON roll (1D6/1D8 hit point loss per round). This 
continues until the target falls to zero hit points (death) 
or The Black is dispelled.
Other than the death of the sorcerer or persuading the 
sorcerer to lift the spell, only large quantities of running 
water are said to dispel The Black.
Alternative names: Black Blood, Curse of Black Blood,  
Sanguineous Atrabilious.
