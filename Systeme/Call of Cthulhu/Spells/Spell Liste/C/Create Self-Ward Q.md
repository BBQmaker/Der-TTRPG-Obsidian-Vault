 Cast
ing time: variable (days)
This mighty spell effectively slows down the advance of 
age, as well as protecting its user from physical damage. 
This is a rare and powerful enchantment. Besides the benefit of longer life, the ward-bag (if held or worn) deflects damage equal to the number of magic points sacrificed in creating it. If the ward-bag is not in the 
possession of the caster but has not been destroyed, he or 
she receives half of such protection (round up fractions).
The caster must gather personal effects, hair, nail 
clippings, etc., and place them within a small leather or cloth bag. The caster then spends several days in close 
contact with the bag; each day uttering ritual chants while 
expending a chosen number of magic points.
The subsequent rate of ageing depends on the days spent 
in creating the Self-Ward. If 3 days, 3 magic points per day 
are spent, and the caster thereafter ages one year for every 
three. If 6 days, 6 magic points per day are spent, and the 
caster thereafter ages one year for every six, and so on. On 
the final day of the ritual, the user must endow the bag with 
POW points equal to five times the number of days spent 
creating the Self-Ward, and 1D6 Sanity points for each day.
If the ward-bag is destroyed or emptied, or the caster is 
killed, this spell is broken. If the spell is broken, the caster 
rapidly ages until physical age agrees with chronological 
age (see Aging, page 98, Call of Cthulhu Rulebook). He or 
she also loses a number of CON points equal to the POW 
placed in the Self-Ward.
Deeper magic: drawing upon their hideous knowledge, 
insane casters may use the ward-bag to reverse the ageing 
process by sacrificing the lifeblood of another person. The 
wizard intones a chant while draining the blood from the 
sacrifice, collecting this in a specially inscribed copper 
bowl. The ward-bag is then placed in to the bowl during 
a new moon. Over the course of five days, the ward-bag 
soaks up the blood. This process removes 10 years from the 
caster’s age for each day the caster invested in making the 
bag—thus if 3 days were spent making the bag, a wizard’s 
age would decrease by 30 years.
