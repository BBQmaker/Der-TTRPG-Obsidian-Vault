This spell does not reach forward or backward in time; 
if a Yithian mind occupies a subject within one hundred 
miles of the caster, the Yithian notices the appeal and may 
respond if curious, fearful, or alarmed. If the caster has 
nothing interesting to say or offer, then the Great Race 
scholar ignores later questions or perhaps destroys the 
caster as a likely pest or nuisance.
