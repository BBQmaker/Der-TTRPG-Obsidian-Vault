ing time: 1D6+4 rounds
A space containing an angle no greater than 120 degrees 
is required. The caster marks the space with geometric 
magical formulae and speaks a repeating phrase. There 
is no known way to bargain with a hound of [[Tindalos]], 
whose motive for moving through the stream of time and 
space is pure hunger.
