Contact Spirits of the Dead 9
• Cost:  3+ magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1D6+4 rounds
Many versions of this spell exist. One version requires a 
tent of white sheets to be erected near a river. Jugs filled  
water from the river are placed inside. Songs are sung and 
dances danced. An entreaty is made for the dead to appear. 
The caster may invest as many magic points as desired 
above 3 (those supporting may invest 1 magic point each). 
Add up the magic points and multiply the sum by five, 
with the caster needing to roll equal to or under that result 
on 1D100. With a success, the voices of the dead emerge 
from the water jugs. One may hear and question them by 
putting one’s head in the tent. Remember that the dead 
mostly know only what they knew in life, and some may 
not be aware that they are dead.
