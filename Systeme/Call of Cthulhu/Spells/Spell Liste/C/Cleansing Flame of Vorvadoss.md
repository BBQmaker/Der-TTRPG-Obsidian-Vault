Cleansing Flame of Vorvadoss 8
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
This potent spell drives back extra-dimensional entities 
to their own dimension. Known to the ancient priests of 
Mu, knowledge of this spell is now thought to be lost. 
The caster (and others who know the spell) can expend as 
many magic points as desired. Other participants, who do not 
know the spell, may contribute 1 magic point each, provided 
they are in physical contact with the caster. The total number 
of magic points donated to the spell is multiplied by five and 
rolled against the POW of the opposing creature. Success 
forces the entity back to their own dimension in a blinding 
flash of prismatic light, although it does not prevent it from 
being summoned forth at a later date.
It is said the Elder God, Vorvadoss, may teach the spell 
to a favored acolyte (costing the recipient the sacrifice of 
5 POW); subsequently learning this spell from such a 
person requires no sacrifice of POW, but costs 4 Sanity 
points and requires 12 hours of time, followed by a Hard 
INT roll to successfully learn the spell.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Vorvadoss.
Alternative names: none known.
