ing time: instantaneous
Blocks the target’s ability to consciously remember a particular event. The caster must be able to see the 
target and the target must be able to receive the caster’s 
instructions. The spell takes effect immediately if the caster 
succeeds in an opposed POW roll with the target. If the 
caster wins, the target has one specified incident blocked 
from their memory. If the incident was terrifying, the target 
may thereafter still have nightmares vaguely relating to it. Opposite: Cleansing Flame of V orvadoss by Goomi

If the spell fails, the event in question becomes vivid in 
the target’s mind.
The caster must know the specific event to be blocked. The 
caster cannot command something vague such as, “Forget 
what you did yesterday.” Instead, he or she must cite a certain 
event, such as, “Forget you were assaulted by a monster.” This 
spell cannot block knowledge of spells or of the Cthulhu 
Mythos unless the knowledge is firmly tied to a specific 
event, nor can it undo a Sanity loss or reverse insanity.
Deeper magic: for each additional 10 magic points 
invested, the caster receives a bonus die to the opposed 
POW roll to determine the spell’s success.
Alternative names: Befuddle, Dumbfound, Mystify.
