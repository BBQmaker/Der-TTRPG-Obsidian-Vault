Forces a being from another plane of existence or dimension to

of POW sacrificed, the chance of success rises by 2 percentiles.

has begun. To be effective, the being’s name must be known 
or it must have been seen by one of the circle or the caster. 
The entity must be nearby, within a couple of miles.Alternative names: Banishment of the Awful Foulness, The
