Call Forth The Worm 9
• Cost:  10 magic points; 15 POW; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 10 hours
This necromantic spell is known to chosen members of 
the Cult of Tulzscha and is used to resurrect the spirit of a 
dead person, usually one of the most devoted worshippers 
of the Green Flame. 
The target of the spell must be deceased and must have 
been interred in the ground for at least two weeks. The 
caster begins a ceremonial chant to awaken the soul of the 
deceased within the bodies of charnel worms that have 
been devouring the corpse. The ceremony lasts ten hours, 
during which the caster sacrifices 10 magic points and 15 
POW. At the end of this time, the target of the spell makes 
a POW roll (using the target’s POW at the time of death): 
if successful, the deceased is reborn 10D10 hours later as 
a writhing mass of grave worms. The awakened crawling 
one retains the INT, POW, memories, skills, spells, and so 
forth, it had at the time of death. All other statistics are 
that of a crawling one (if applicable, Sanity is reduced to zero). If the POW roll fails, the spell is unsuccessful, and the target cannot be resurrected by this spell. 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Note: not all Crawling Ones are created using this spell. In 
some instances, the sheer will of the deceased individual is 
sufficient to infest the crawling grave worms with their essence.
