 Cast
ing time: instantaneous 
Promotes deep slumber for those in close proximity 
to the caster. Locating, preparing, and combining the 
essential wild herbs may take up to a week depending on 
circumstances and availability. The spells allows for the 
creation of 1D6 doses of dust.
Once created, a handful of coyote dust (one dose) can be 
tossed into the flames of fire, creating a large, momentary 
puff of smoke, effective for everyone within 10 yards of 
the fire. Everyone affected makes an opposed POW roll 
versus the caster: if failed, they succumb to a deep sleep 
for 3D10 minutes. Loud noises or violent activity near the 
sleepers may wake them prematurely.
Alternative names: Slumber Powder, Witch Soil.
