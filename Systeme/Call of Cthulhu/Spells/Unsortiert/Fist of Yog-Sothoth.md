Fist of Yog-Sothoth 6
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Causes a massive, invisible force to hit a single target. The 
caster must be able to see the target. Each magic point 
invested yields 2D10 STR of force. For every 30 feet of 
distance that the caster stands from the target (after the first 
thirty feet), the caster must spend an additional magic point.
When the target is struck (if a living thing), an opposed roll 
must be made using the spell’s STR versus the target’s CON. 
If the roll is successful, the target is knocked unconscious. 
Whether or not the target is left unconscious, the target is 
always pushed away from the caster for a distance in feet 
equal to the STR of the blow minus the target’s SIZ.
The spell can be used against inanimate objects, such 
as doors or walls. Results may be obvious, but sometimes 
Keepers will have to determine these cases based upon the 
STR of the object.
For example: the caster spends 5 magic points to hit an 
investigator 50 feet away. 1 magic point is spent on the range. 
The other 4 generate a STR of 8D10 that are rolled for a result of 
57. The investigator fails a Hard CON roll (since the spells STR 
is over 50) and so they are knocked unconscious. The investigator 
has a SIZ of 45 and is bowled back 12 feet by the impact.
