Reanimation 7
• Cost: 6 magic points; 5 POW; 3D6 Sanity points
• Casting time: 6 hours
Not to be confused with the scientific process of 
reanimation discovered by Dr. Herbert West, this spell 
creates a form of self-aware zombie under the control of 
its creator. The entity retains all knowledge and skills that 
it possessed in life. This ghastly spell requires a recently 
dead human corpse, which retains sufficient flesh to allow 
mobility upon activation. The name of the deceased must be 
known to the caster. The ritual is an elaborate incantation 
made while the caster washes the corpse with their tongue. s

Should the walking dead suffer injury, like the severing 
of an arm or head, it can be sewn back on the body without 
undue impediment. The death of the caster frees the 
reanimated corpse from servitude but, unlike a zombie, the 
reanimated corpse continues to function after its creator’s 
demise as an independent monster.
Deeper magic: while the reanimated retains knowledge 
and skills, it does not necessarily retain knowledge of any 
spells it knew in life. Certain sorcerers are able to negate 
this consequence, allowing the walking corpse full access to its spell arsenal—in this event, the creature retains the amount of POW it had in life. 
Alternative names: Undying Servitude, Create Faithful 
Servant, Life to the Flesh.
