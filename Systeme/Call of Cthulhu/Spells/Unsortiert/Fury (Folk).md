Fury (Folk) 0
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1D4 sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Induces a furious, berserk rage in the target, making him 
or her fight recklessly and with savage abandon. The caster 
may direct the spell upon him or herself, or another target 
(requiring an opposed POW roll if the target is unwilling).
The spell increases the number of attacks to 2 (assuming 
they normally have 1 attack per round); both attacks are 
performed on the character’s normal DEX value.
This spell lowers the natural instinct for self-
preservation. The furious character ignores any 
unconsciousness stemming from a major wound. A fatal 
wound is still fatal to the enraged character but he or she 
attacks until the end of the round of their death, potentially 
striking blows while technically dead, and then finally 
keeling over at the end of the round. During the fury, 
the character can only take actions directly related to the 
most immediate form of combat (no magic, no healing, 
etc.) The Keeper decides whether an action qualifies as a 
combat action or otherwise. If there are no viable enemies 
left, the berserk character will attack allies unless they can 
make a Hard INT roll to come out of the fury.
The fury lasts for 5 rounds, although every 5 magic 
points invested above the initial cost increases the length 
of the berserk rage for one round. Once cast, the caster 
cannot add additional magic points unless the spell is recast 
(requiring being able to touch the furious person).
Alternative names: Curse of the Wolf, Words of Berserk, 
Infernal Anger.
