As a harassment or warning, the caster is able to project his 
or her image onto the surface of a mirror or mirroring surface 
that is being gazed into by the caster’s intended target. 
The target can be anywhere on Earth. The caster needs 
a mirror large enough to see his or her full head and neck. 
Gazing within it and keeping an image of the target in 
mind, the caster utters the incantation and waits. When the 
target looks into a darkened window, a mirror, or any other 
mirroring surface, an image of the caster begins to form. If 
the caster tires before the target looks into a mirror, that 
loss of attention breaks the spell.
Sometimes the mirror image of the caster is looking 
directly into the eyes of the target. At other times the 
caster may be seen standing directly behind the target in 
the reflection. If the target wears glasses, images reflected 
in the lenses may even be resolved. The target can hear 
words and short phrases uttered by the caster. The caster 
can see through his or her mirror as well, seeing the target 
in their surroundings.
Alternative names: The Silvery Warning, Reflection of Hate, 
The All Seeing Eye.
