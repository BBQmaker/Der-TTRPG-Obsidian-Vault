Petrify M C
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 days
Creates an alchemical liquid that causes the drinker to become 
petrified. The concoction requires a successful Hard Chemistry 
roll and three days work preparing the necessary elements in a 
laboratory. Upon completion, the caster will have a colorless, 
bad-tasting liquid. Whoever drinks this fluid must succeed 
in an opposed POW roll against the number of magic points 
invested in the liquid multiplied by five. Failure means that, 
over the next 1D4 minutes, the target’s tissues rapidly calcify, 
transforming them into a statue. Success means that the liquid 
does not take effect. The petrification is permanent, although 
magical means to reverse its effect may exist.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos 
or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure that directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names:  Mineralization of Flesh, Drink of Stone, 
Curse of Ossification.
