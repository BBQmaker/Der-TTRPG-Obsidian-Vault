Deflection (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1 Sanity point

 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. By waving 
their hand in front of them, the caster causes offensive 
spells targeted against them to be knocked aside. To 
determine whether or not Deflection works, the caster 
makes an opposed POW roll against the caster of the attacking spell. If the opponent fails to overcome the 
Deflection, the attacking spell is knocked aside harmlessly.
Deeper magic: the caster may cause the deflected spell 
to “hit” another within their line of sight (but not the 
original spell’s caster). Wizards, for many centuries, have been trying to find a way of reproducing this spell in the 
Waking World but little to no success. Should such a 
wizard be able to perfect the formulae for the Waking 
World, their powers would be most impressive.

Digression.
