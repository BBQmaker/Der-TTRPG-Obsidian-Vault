Eviscerator (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  variable magic points; 2D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. This 
gruesome spell causes a roiling cluster of black jagged 
objects, dark violet bursts of fog, and red-yellow bolts of 
energy to be shot at a target. The Eviscerator rips open its 
victim, delivering 1D6 damage per 8 magic points invested 
in the spell. Despite the target having no way to resist this 
attack, any armor (if worn) does limit its damage.
Alternative names: Cacophony of Doom, Black Bolts of Death, 
Judgment of P’Tan.
