Koshchey’s Death Q
• Cost:  5 POW; 2D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 week
Protects the caster from death, but at a price. After 
a weeklong ritual, a portion of the caster’s life force is deposited inside an egg for safekeeping. Thereafter, if reduced to zero hit points the caster does not die but instead falls into a coma-like state until his or her hit 
points are raised to 1 or more.If the caster’s body is dismembered, burnt, chained to the 
bottom of the sea, or obliterated in some other reasonably 
conclusive way, the caster dies despite the protection 
afforded by the spell. Also, if the egg is broken, the caster 
immediately perishes.
In order to support the coma and the mental strain of 
life within the egg, the caster takes on a mania or phobia (consulting with the Keeper). 
Deeper magic: the spell originated in Russia, named after a 
legendary sorcerer, Koshchey the Deathless.
Alternative names: none known.
