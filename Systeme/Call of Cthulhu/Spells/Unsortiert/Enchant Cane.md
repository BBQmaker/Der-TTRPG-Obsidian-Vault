Enchant Cane M
• Cost:  30 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 7 days
Creates an artifact able to drain magic points from others, 
storing them to be usable by the cane’s owner. Casting 
the spell and creating the cane requires a week’s work, a 
human sacrifice, and some form of inflexible object, such 
as a cane. Once created, each use of the cane costs the user 
1D3 Sanity points. 
When anyone but the cane’s creator touches the enchanted 
cane for more than 30 seconds, he or she loses a magic point 
and the object accumulates a magic point. The person losing 
the magic points immediately feels queasy and profoundly 
uneasy. The object can be held against a target until all magic 
points are drained away, after which hit points are drained 
one by one (until either unconsciousness or death). When 
a magic point from the cane is used in casting a spell, it 
is used-up permanently. Once the cane is empty of magic 
points, another victim must be found to recharge it.
Deeper magic: a variant spell enchants a glove to produce 
the same effects.
