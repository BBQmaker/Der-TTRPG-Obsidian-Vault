Pipes of Madness C
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
Those hearing this spell risk insanity. The spell must be cast 
with the enchanted bone pipe created by the spell Create 
Curse Whistle (page 86). The caster plays a specific weird 
melody on the pipes and sacrifices the necessary costs.
All within earshot of the strange melody should make a 
Sanity roll: failure causes the loss of 5 Sanity points and an 
immediate bout of madness (the listener going temporarily 
insane); if the Sanity roll is successful, the listener loses 
1D3 Sanity points (and ordinarily does not go insane). 
Listeners should make a Sanity roll for every 5 rounds that 
the pipes are played and heard (losses being cumulative). 
Should the player of the pipes have Sanity to lose, they may 
be asked to also make a single Sanity roll at the end of the first 
five rounds of playing (at the Keeper’s discretion). If such a roll 
is failed, the player goes temporarily insane (losing 5 Sanity 
points) and becomes locked into playing the otherworldly tune 
for as long as possible. Listeners may attempt to prevent further 
playing if they can successfully resist the melody’s effect.
Alternate names: The Dark Song of the Heavens, Ye Abyssal 
Melody, Harmony of the Seven Hells.
