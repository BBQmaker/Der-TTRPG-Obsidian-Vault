Steal Life’s Blood Q 7
• Cost:  20 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1D6+1 rounds
Allows the caster to resurrect the dead by way of human 
sacrifice. The caster must win an opposed POW roll with 
a person to be sacrificed in the performance of this spell: 
if the caster fails, the sacrificial victim is unaffected but 
the caster suffers 1D10 points of reflected damage. If the 
caster is successful, all of the sacrificial victim’s blood leaves 
their body and gathers in a ball, floating above them. Once 
all of the sacrifice’s blood has been drained (taking 1D6 
rounds), it flows through the air to cover and enter a corpse 
awaiting resurrection (prepared by the caster). Within 1D6 
minutes the corpse is reborn. Witnessing this ritual calls 
for a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss).
A significant side effect means that forevermore the 
reanimated corpse will have an unquenchable thirst for 
living blood. 
Alternative names: Life Through Blood, Rite of 
Exsanguination, Resurrection.
