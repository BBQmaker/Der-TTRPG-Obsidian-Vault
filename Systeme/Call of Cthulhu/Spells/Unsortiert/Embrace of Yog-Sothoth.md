Embrace of Yog-Sothoth C
• Cost:  18 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 4 rounds
Ages the target until they wither away and turn to dust. 
The caster must win an opposed POW roll against the 
spell’s target: if successful, the target loses 5 CON per 
round until, at zero CON, they are completely drained 
of life and withered to dust. Witnessing the effect of the 
spell upon another provokes a Sanity roll (1/1D8 loss). 
The spell’s effects may be halted if the caster can be 
convinced to cease the spell, or if the caster is killed before 
it is too late (any CON lost up to this point is forever gone). 
Certain protective spells or talismans may resist the embrace.
Alternative names: Withering, Time’s Dust, The Purple Sign 
of the Opener of the Way.
