Send Dream G
• Cost: 5 magic points; 1 Sanity point
• Casting time: 10 minutes
The caster sends a short, specific dream to a target (a 
single scene or an image or emotion, such as foreboding or 
horror). A special etched, copper bowl is required, which is 
filled with herbs and blood from the caster and set alight, 
producing a greenish smoke. The target must be asleep and 
within 20 miles of the caster and the caster must win an 
opposed POW roll with the sleeping target for the dream 
sending to be successful. 
Deeper magic: a variant causes horrific nightmares derived 
from the Mythos knowledge of the caster (who must have 
at least 20% in Cthulhu Mythos). The spell cost is the 
same, except the Sanity cost is 6 points. Upon waking, 
the spell’s target recalls the nightmare, resulting in a 1D4 
Sanity point loss. Should successive Mythos induced 
nightmares be directed at the same target over a prolonged 
period, the target may gain points in the Cthulhu Mythos 
skill at the discretion of the Keeper.
