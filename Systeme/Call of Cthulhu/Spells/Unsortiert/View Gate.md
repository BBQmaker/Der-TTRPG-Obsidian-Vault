View Gate O
• Cost:  variable magic; variable Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
When cast at a suspected Gate (page 120), this spell allows 
the caster to see what, if anything, is on the other side of 
the Gate without having to go through it. Viewing is a 
variable cost, half of the Gate’s magic point cost (round 
up fractions). Thus a Gate costing 8 magic points to pass 
through requires 4 magic points and 4 Sanity points to 
view through. The viewing lasts 1D6+1 rounds. If there 
is something horrific to see, additional Sanity loss may be 
required for each viewer. Viewers may attempt appropriate 
skill rolls to learn where, when, or what is being viewed.
