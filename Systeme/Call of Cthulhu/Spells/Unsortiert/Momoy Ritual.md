ime: 1 day
Fortifies the subject for some important or dangerous 
task. The ritual is dangerous to undertake, requiring the consumption of a draught of seawater infused with the 
momoy plant (of the genus Datura, known to the Spanish 
as “toloache,” and English speakers as “Jimson weed” or 
“Devil’s Trumpet”). This plant is poisonous and contains 
hallucinogenic alkaloids. Once brewed, the infusion subjects 
the drinker to a strong poison (2D10 damage, halved with an 
Extreme CON roll). If the infusion is brewed for two days 
and a further 6 magic points invested, the poison is reduced 
to mild (1D10 damage, halved with an Extreme CON roll).
For 2D6 hours after drinking the potion, the imbiber’s 
body is incapacitated but their mind is able to wander the 
Dreamlands (possibly to seek some information that will 
be of use in the Waking World). When the subject wakes, 
they are energized, receiving an increase of 20 points of 
STR for one day and is considered to have an additional 
20 CON for purposes of resisting the effects of poison (no 
actual hit points are gained). Also, for 24 hours, any damage 
received will be removed first from the imbiber’s magic 
points (until depleted, and then from hit points as usual).At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, 
Botany, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure 
that directions for the infusion are carefully followed.
