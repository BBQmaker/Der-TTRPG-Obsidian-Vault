Yellow Spirit-Leap Seal (Folk) 0
• Cost:  4+ magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ round
Creates a magical barrier that repels wild animals and
Earthly supernatural entities (such as vampires and
wraiths). Mythos monsters (such as ghouls, deep ones,
etc.) are unaffected. Each person, including the caster,
protected by the barrier sacrifices 4 magic points. Though
the caster is protected immediately, each additional person
requires an additional round for the barrier to encompass
them (determine the order randomly).
The spell requires that the caster first constructs a
seal—a block of hardwood about four inches across,
engraved symbols and words of protection (an appropriate
Art/Craft roll may be required at the Keeper’s discretion).
The piece of wood is not magical but is necessary in stamping the seal into the earth around oneself, to
delineate and confirm the magical barrier. The spell lasts 6
hours. During that time if an affected creature approaches
the barrier it must win an opposed POW roll with the
caster: if the creature fails, it is not only barred but repelled
and it flees from the area.
Alternative names: Confirm Sacred Ground, Repel Creature
of the Night.
