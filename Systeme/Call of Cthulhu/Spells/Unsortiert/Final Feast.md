Final Feast B
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1+ Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ day
Allows the caster to sway or brainwash another person. If 
a target is particularly weak, or if the caster is very strong, 
it may be possible to consume the target’s soul.
The spell is very old and complex. The preparations 
for casting may take a full day or more. The spell involves 
twenty parts: each part is recited during the preparation of 
an individual dish that will be part of a great feast. Each 
part, and thus each dish, has an associated word of power 
with it. All of the words are very short (i.e. one syllable).
The target is invited to partake of the lavish feast. During 
the meal, the caster subtly mentions each of the words of 
power. Each time a word is spoken, the target makes two 
rolls: an opposed POW roll with the caster, and a CON roll.
• Opposed POW roll: if the caster wins, the target loses 
5 POW. 
•
 C
ON roll: if failed, the target loses 5 CON.
As the target succumbs to the spell, he or she grows 
more ravenous for the food being served. Should the target 
wish to resist, they may attempt a Hard INT roll in order 
to refrain from eating any more of the food (the difficulty 
is increased to Extreme if the caster has either a Charm, 
Fast Talk, or Persuade skill of 90% or greater). Each time 
5 POW is lost, the caster gets to make a suggestion to the 
target, who is allowed another opposed POW roll in order 
to escape complete acquiescence. If the target loses 25 or 
more points of POW, the host may suggest complex and 
even self-endangering actions. Again, the target is allowed 
an opposed POW roll to escape effect. If a target’s POW 
or CON falls to 0, they are dead.
The utterance of a word of power costs the caster 1 
magic point per individual at the dinner table that the 
caster wishes to affect. Each suggestion made costs the 
caster a minimum of 1 Sanity point; although, this rises to 
2 points or more (at the Keeper’s discretion) for complex 
and self-endangering suggestions.
