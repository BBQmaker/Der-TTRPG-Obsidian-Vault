Solar Gaze 6 b
• Cost:  8+ magic points; 2D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Causes the air to thicken and form a temporary lens, which 
intensifies the searing power of the sun. The caster recites 
a ritual phrase and 1D10 minutes later, the surrounding air 
grows dense and resolves into a lens above the target. Each 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
round, the lens causes 1D6 damage as the rays of the sun 
fry the target’s flesh, which bubbles and burns, ultimately 
leaving a smoking, blackened carcass. For every 8 magic 
points spent, the spell’s effects last two rounds.
The caster must target the spell on something or 
someone that they can see, with the lens following that 
subject around. Shelter from the sun will dampen the spell 
(going inside a deep cave would negate the spell’s effects). 
The spell may only be cast in daylight and when the sun 
is at least partially visible (a Luck roll may be required).
The target should make a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss), as 
well as any witnesses (1/1D4 loss). Those within 5 yards 
of the target also suffer 1D4 points of damage per round until they move away. 
Alternative names: Amaterasu’s Gaze, Spite of Cthuggha, 
The Searing.
