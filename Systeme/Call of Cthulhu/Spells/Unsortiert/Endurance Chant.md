 Cast
ing time: 1 hour 
Allows the caster to comfortably engage in great physical 
exertion for up to six hours. Immediately after casting, the 
caster has their CON and STR increased by 30 points for 
six hours (this may temporarily increase hit points and 
damage bonus).
The caster may (optionally) choose to ignore all pain, 
thereby becoming immune to physical shock and physical 
(but not mental) causes of unconsciousness. When the spell 
concludes, the caster feels calm and invigorated but must 
make a successful CON roll or permanently lose 5 CON. 
This spell cannot be cast upon another creature. 
Alternative names: Capacity of the Beast, Flinch Not from 
the Travails of Struggle.
