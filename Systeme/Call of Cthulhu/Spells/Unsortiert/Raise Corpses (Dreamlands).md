Raise Corpses (Dreamlands) H
• Cost: 50 magic points; 2D10 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1 round
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Raises 
all corpses within 50 yards of the caster, and causes the 
risen terrors to seize and devour victims within the caster’s 
field of vision. A short, repeating chant is called out by 
the caster, which often provokes a sudden temperature 
drop and occasional lightning. The number of corpses in 
the vicinity should be determined by the Keeper. Those 
witnessing the rise of the dead should make a Sanity roll 
(1/1D8 loss). 
Alternative names: Gatherer of the Dead, The Instele Rite, 
Unleash the Ravenous Ones.
