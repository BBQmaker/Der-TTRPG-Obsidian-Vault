Enchant Animal Effigy M
• Cost:  10 POW; 1D4 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1 day
Creates a powerful protective and tutelary talisman. To 
work properly, steatite (soapstone) from Santa Catalina 
Island, roughly the size of a fist, must be carved into the 
shape of an animal (using an appropriate Art/Craft skill 
roll). During a ritual lasting a day, the stone becomes 
imbued with the spirit of an animal guardian. The precise 
aid the talisman provides its owner is tied to the type of 
animal depicted, with exact details left to the Keeper. Three 
sample suggestions follow.
Once a month the spirit of the effigy may be consulted 
regarding a problem or a proposed course of action: this 
requires 4 magic points and 1D4 Sanity points. There is no 
guarantee the spirit will respond or that the response will 
be helpful. An animal effigy taken from someone else is 
worthless without the proper ritual performed all over again.
