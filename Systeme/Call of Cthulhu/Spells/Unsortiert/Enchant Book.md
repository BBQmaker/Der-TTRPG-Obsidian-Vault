Enchant Book M
• Cost:  variable POW; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 days
Aids in summoning star vampires by enchanting a book 
in which is inscribed the words of the spell Summon Star 
Vampire ( page 177). The book’s ink must contain the ichor 
of a star vampire. The caster meditates for three days and 
sacrifices a varying amount of POW: for each point of 
POW channeled into the book add +2 percentiles to the 
caster’s chance of success with Summon/Bind Star Vampire.
Deeper magic: various versions of this spell exist which 
assist in the specific summoning of a lesser Mythos entity. 
Another powerful variant allows the caster to fully infuse 
the book with the summoning and (possibly, but not 
always) the binding component of a summon spell; when 
the book’s words are read aloud (by anyone) the spell is 
automatically cast (with the reader losing 1D10 magic 
points and 1D4 Sanity points)—the Keeper should roll 
1D100 and if the outcome is 80 or less, the summoning 
is successful. The caster preparing such a book invests 40 POW to produce the automatic effect.
