particular place. The spell has an approximate range 
equivalent to that of an average house. The caster must 
be present in the area. The spell allows the caster to 
distinguish species (such as a dog or a person), but not 
to recognize specific individuals. The caster can detect 
a living presence and its general location, but not with 
pinpoint precision.
