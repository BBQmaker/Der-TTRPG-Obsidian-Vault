Liquid Death 6

This particularly nasty spell only works upon terrestrial 
creatures, not monsters from other worlds or dimensions. 
For example, humans, animals, serpent folk, deep ones, 
and sand dwellers are affected, but not hunting horrors, 
servitors of the Outer Gods, and Great Old Ones. The 
spell is directed at one target, who must be visible to the 
caster. The caster must win an opposed POW roll with 
the target: if successful, the target has 1D4 rounds to cease 
movement, otherwise the integrity of their flesh and bones 
collapses and they melt into a puddle of congealed liquid 
flesh, causing instant death. If the target does not move, 
remaining motionless, they can remain in a solid state, but 
significant movement will cause them to liquefy—this state 
of affairs calls for a Sanity roll for each 10 minutes while 
in this state (1D3 loss is they succeed in a Sanity roll, but 
if failed the horror becomes too much and they give into 
the Liquid Death and die. Those already insane should 
attempt a POW roll every 10 minutes or they too dissolve. 
It is possible to speak while under the effects of the spell, 
so long as words are spoken slowly, softly, and carefully. 
The spell can be reversed, with the same costs. The other 
way to combat the effect is to cool the victim to below the 
freezing point of water, after which time they can operate 
normally; however, if ever their temperature rises, they 
begin to melt away. A successful Cthulhu Mythos roll may 
provide insight into this bizarre remedy. 
Witnessing the spell’s effect on a human costs 1D4/1D8 
Sanity points.
Alternative names: Dissolution, Melt Flesh, The Terrible 
Dissolve.
