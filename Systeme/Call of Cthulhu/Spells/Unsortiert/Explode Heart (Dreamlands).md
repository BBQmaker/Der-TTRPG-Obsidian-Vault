Explode Heart (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  12 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The caster 
points at the target and concentrates for three rounds. An 
opposed POW roll with the spell’s target is then made: if 
successful, the target’s heart begins to pound uncontrollably, 
quickly building in strength and tempo until, after 1D6 
rounds, it explodes through the chest wall. The target dies 
immediately; witnesses make a Sanity roll (0/1D4 loss). 
Quick thinking may save a target of this spell: a 
successful Dreaming or Cthulhu Mythos roll (possibly 
others at the Keeper’s discretion) might cancel or alter 
the effect, reducing the consequences to the loss of either 
2D6 hit points, 2D6 magic points, or 2D6 Sanity points 
as chosen by the Keeper.
Alternative names: The Dread Finger of Doom, The 
Unremitting Agony, Heart’s Embrace.
