Minim (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. With a range 
of 10 yards, this spell forms a long series of rapidly contracting 
rings which whip towards the target and cause them to 
permanently lose 5 SIZ for every 8 magic points invested in 
the spell—unless the target can win an opposed POW roll 
with the caster. If the target’s SIZ reaches 5, each additional 
4 magic points causes the loss of 5 CON instead. Every 10 
points of SIZ lost also causes the target to lose 5 STR.
Alternative names: Diminish, Spear of Reduction, Shrink.
