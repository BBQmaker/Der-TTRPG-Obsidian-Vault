Song of Hastur 6
• Cost:  1D4+ magic points; 1D4+ Sanity points 
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds 
A hideous wailing ululation by the caster causes the skin 
and flesh of the target to bubble and fester into pestilential 
blobs. The target must be visible to the caster. Though 
everyone can hear the song, the spell affects only the 
desired target. This spell will only work if cast at night 
and only if the star Aldebaran is visible (best observed 
between Fall and Spring). The caster must succeed in a 
POW roll in order to correctly sing the alien melody. The 
caster expends 1D4 magic points and 1D4 Sanity points 
per round until either they stop the spell or their magical 
energies are spent. 
Successfully cast, the spell causes the target 1D6 hit 
points damage per round the spell is active. After every two 
rounds, scarring reduces the target’s APP by 3D10. After 
every four rounds, internal ruptures reduce CON by 3D10 
points. When the target’s CON reaches zero (or death 
occurs from hit point loss), the body swells up and then 
bursts with a sickening pop as steamy gore covers all nearby.
Deeper magic: the song can be used defensively to guard 
against another caster of this spell. Opposing castings 
neutralize one other.

Yellow, Bring Forth the Festering Boil of Great Agony and 
Torment.
