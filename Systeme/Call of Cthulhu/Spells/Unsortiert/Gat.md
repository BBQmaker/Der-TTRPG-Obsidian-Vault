• Cost to access:
 variable magic points; 1 Sanity point
Gate allows the caster to create doorways between other 
lands or times, dimensions or worlds—allowing the user 
to travel great distances with a simple step. Usually a Gate 
connects to a single other location. 
Creation of a Gate requires the permanent expenditure 
of POW in a sacrifice equal to the log to base 10 of the 
distance the Gate connects in miles multiplied by five (see 
Table: Gate Creation and Travel Costs, and Gates: Sample 
Locations and Distances, pages 122 and 123). A Gate 
may take many forms: common ones being indicated by 
a pattern of painted lines on a floor or wall, or a peculiar 
arrangement of stones in a field. The media used to “paint” 
the Gate sigils can likewise take many forms: chalk, paint, 
blood, carving, and so on.
Using the Gate costs a number of magic points equal to 
one-fifth of the POW originally used to make the Gate. 
Each trip through a Gate costs 1 Sanity point. Should 
the user lack enough magic points for a trip, the traveler 
expends hit points to make up the cost. Return trips 
through a Gate always cost the same as the initial journey.
Ordinarily, anyone or anything can move through a 
Gate, though some have been built so that a certain key—a 
word or gesture—is needed to activate the portal. Certain 
versions of the spell are known that also “change” those 
who pass through, to aid survival on an alien world. There 
are also hints that some Gates are capable of arriving at 
more than one destination.
Note: also see Time Gate, page 179.
Deeper magic: the caster may elect to prepare a Gate for 
travel by expending the necessary magic points before 
the journey. The Gate is thus primed and the next person 
stepping through the doorway is not required to pay the 
magic point cost, but will still need to sacrifice 1 Sanity point.
