Levitate
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Causes the caster or a chosen target to float slowly through 
the air. The caster must be able to touch the target. 1 magic 
point per 5 points of SIZ of the person to be levitated must 
be invested. The spell levitates the target 3–5 feet off the 
ground for 1D6 minutes. If falling from a height, the target 
falls in slow motion and halts several feet off the ground. 
Each extra magic point expended during the spell’s effect 
allows the user to move the target one yard horizontally 
or vertically. The target floats as the caster wills, helpless 
to stop moving except by grabbing a tree limb or similar 
brace. In that case, an opposed roll is made: the target’s 
STR against the caster’s POW. If the target wins, the spell 
is broken and the target falls to the ground.
Alternative names: Command Gravity, Tremulous 
Suspension.
