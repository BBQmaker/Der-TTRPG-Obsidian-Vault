Reversed Angles of Tagh-Clatur 9
• Cost:  15 POW; 1D20 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
As revealed by ancient Egyptian priests, this spell opens 
the dimension in which the full entity of Gla’aki resides. 
Highly mathematical in nature, this spell cannot be 
attempted by anyone with an INT of less than 90. When 
cast, it opens a Gate between Gla’aki’s dimension and our 
own, allowing the part of Gla’aki that inhabits our world 
to connect to its full being, allowing the Great Old One 
to exert far more influence in our world. 
This spell can be reversed in order to cease the 
connection, or to close any other existing Gate.
Alternative names: Tagh-Clatur Observance, End Gate.

Saaamaaa Ritual 2
• Cost : 30 POW
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 hours
Creates a protective barrier, effective against the minions of 
the Outer Gods and the Great Old Ones. A complicated 
ritual involves inscribing the Eight Signs of Surety on the 
ground between two circles (drawn in chalk, or similar). 
The ritual creates a magical barrier through which no 
Mythos minion or supernatural entity (vampires, zombies, 
etc.) may pass. The magical circle created is large enough 
for up to eight people (although a smaller circle holding 
up to 4 people, taking 1 hour to prepare, may be used) and 
lasts for 24 minus 1D10 hours.
Deeper magic: inscribing the first and eighth Signs of 
Surety and connecting them with three straight lines 
may seal an entranceway from use by Mythos minions. 
This shortened version of the ritual requires 10 rounds to 
cast and costs 10 POW. The enchantment remains until 
a portion of the signs are removed.
Alternative names: Saaamaaa Warding, The Eight 
Inscriptions, Grande Ward.
