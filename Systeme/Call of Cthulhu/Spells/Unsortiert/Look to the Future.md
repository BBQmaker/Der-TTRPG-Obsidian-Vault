Look to the Future e
• Cost: 5 POW per participant; 2D6 Sanity points  
(caster only)
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Casting this spell hurls a willing target a varying number 
of years into the future. After a group chant for an hour, all 
participants in the ceremony lose 5 POW each, except the 
caster of the spell, who loses 2D6 Sanity points instead. Upon 
completion of the chant, the chosen volunteer (who need 
not chant) is physically hurled into the future or past. One 
year passes for each 5 POW expended during the ceremony. 
The spell is imprecise: subtract 1D10 years from the 
desired target date—if the result is a trip into the past, the 
target disappears from existence (one preferably wants at 
least eleven contributors of magic points therefore). After a 
number of hours elapse equal to one-fifth of the volunteer’s 
POW he or she snaps back to the present. To witnesses, the 
volunteer disappears, then reappears a round or two later.
Depending on what it achieves, this spell can provoke 
important historical paradoxes. Note that a major paradox 
should lead swiftly, grimly, and immediately to the madness 
and death of the person initiating it. 
Whether this spell may draw the ire of the hounds of 
Tindalos and other Mythos entities is left to the discretion 
of the Keeper.
Deeper magic: this powerful spell is not thought to be 
written down in any tomes and is believed to be known only 
by Nyarlathotep, who may teach it to an insane worshiper. It 
is completely feasible that the Crawling Chaos could impart 
a variant of the spell that preordains the year/date of arrival 
without the knowledge of the participant.
Alternative names: Blessing of the Bloated Woman, The Dark 
Pharaoh’s Scourge, The Pendulum of Fools.
