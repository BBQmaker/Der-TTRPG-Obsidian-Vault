Skin of the Bear (Folk) 0
• Cost:  5 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 month
Allows the caster to assume the form of a bear for a limited 
time. The caster must first hunt and kill, and then skin a 
bear. Over the course of a month the skin is ritually prepared 
and stuffed with straw in such a fashion that when worn 
it completely covers the caster’s body. Thereafter, with the 
sacrifice of 4 magic points and 3 rounds of preparation, the 
caster can don the suit and be enveloped by the bear’s form. 
The skin is exceedingly difficult to control and requires 
practice. Three loops are sewn inside the left paw; they allow 
the wearer to walk, run, or turn. The bear form has MOV 12 
and affords the wearer 3-point armor. The user gains a new skill Control Bear Skin, which starts at half DEX. Check 
the skill whenever the wearer wishes to perform a difficult 
maneuver (a running leap, for example, or an attack (one 
attack, dealing 3D6 damage). For every 15 minutes that 
the skin is worn, 1 magic point must be paid. 
Note that there is an unchanging risk of 1% that the 
spirit of the bear will consume the wearer, who will forget 
their identity and become a roaming animal until death. 
Once the wearer finds that the skin cannot be removed, 
the transition to beast is made within hours unless some 
form of spirit dismissal can be successfully made.
Deeper magic: variant forms of this spell may exist 
reflecting cultural geographies. Wolf skin and elephant 
hide are two possibilities.
Alternative names: Bear Form, Robe of Claws, Embrace of 
the Beast.
