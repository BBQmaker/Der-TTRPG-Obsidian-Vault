 Cast
ing time: 20 minutes
Calls and attracts a specific soul or spirit if it is currently 
outside its host’s body (such as that of a dreamer). The 
caster and target must be within five miles of one another. 
For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an 
opposed POW roll with the target: if successful, the spirit 
is drawn into the presence of the caster and is subject to 
other spells, such as Bind Soul (page 41). 
If the spirit evades capture, it wanders off. The spirit of 
the dreamer sees the caster and their location (though he 
or she may not recognize the location), and may remember 
the encounter as a particularly vivid dream.
Alternative names: Soul Snare, Soul Fishing, The Trap of 
Endless Slumber.
