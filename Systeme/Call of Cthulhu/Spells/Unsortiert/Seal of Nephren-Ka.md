Seal of Nephren-Ka 2
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: varies (1 round to 1 hour)
Creates a barrier against spirits (embodied or not), as well as 
most spells. Spells cast at living persons within the warded 
area (a 50-foot cube) are resisted by the number of magic 
points sacrificed to the spell. The caster invests as many magic 
points as desired. If magical attacks (spells) are directed 
into the warded area, an opposed POW roll is made by 
the attacking spellcaster versus the number of magic points 
invested multiplied by 5. If the attacker is successful, their 
spell cuts through the ward, destroying it, allowing their 
original spell to function normally. The warded area resists 
all spells except for summoning spells enacted by the caster 
of the Seal of Nephren-Ka; the spell creates a (relatively) 
safe place to perform experimental summonings. 
A “spirit” can cross the barrier by succeeding in an 
opposed POW roll (with a penalty die) versus the number 
of magic points invested multiplied by five. Once an entity 
successfully crosses the Seal, it is destroyed. 
The warded area may take many forms; commonly 
indicated by a complex pattern of lines on a floor, a peculiar 
arrangement of stones in a field, or a grove of trees planted 
and grown in a specific pattern. If the area has previously 
been prepared (trees, grown, stones placed, etc.) then the Seal takes but a round to enact, otherwise, if drawing the 
required glyphs, the casting time increases to 1 hour. The 
Seal will remain in effect, unless broken by a spirit or a 
spell, for 24 hours before dissipating. Deeper magic: investing 10 POW into the spell provides 
for the Seal to remain active for up to five days.
