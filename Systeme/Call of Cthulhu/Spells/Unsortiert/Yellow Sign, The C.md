Yellow Sign, The C B
• Cost:  10 POW; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ hour
Creates the sigil of the King in Yellow. The spell comprises 
two parts. Firstly, using mundane tools (i.e. yellow paint, 
thread, or another medium) the caster draws or fashions 
the hideous Yellow Sign upon a surface. The Sign is not 
active until the second part of the ritual is completed 
(which may be accomplished at a later time) when the 
caster imbues the Sign with power drawn directly from 
Hastur; thus, creating the sigil permanently.
Once the Yellow Sign is active, it provokes disgust and 
uneasy feelings for those who view it (Sanity roll for 0/1D6 
loss). The Sign seems to swirl, shimmer, and squirm, as if 
reaching for the onlooker. This effect takes but a moment; 
however, to the person affected, it feels as if time has 
stood still. 
Those who lose Sanity points from seeing the Yellow 
Sign are cursed; the next time they sleep they should 
make another Sanity roll and if failed, they suffer terrible 
nightmares concerning the King in Yellow, Carcosa, 
and Hastur costing a further point of Sanity. Each time 
thereafter the person sleeps they should make a Sanity 
roll (0/1) and this is repeated each night until either they 
succeed in making a Sanity roll (which prevents further 
Sanity loss) or madness overtakes them. Note that even 
though a successful Sanity roll negates further nightmares 
and Sanity loss, should that person come to view the Yellow 
Sign again, the process is restarted.
If this spell is cast by someone who is not a worshipper of 
Hastur then dire consequences will ensue. The unbeliever 
will begin to see the Yellow Sign everywhere, each time 
automatically losing 1 Sanity point until they become a 
quivering wreck. Once enough Sanity has been lost to 
cause indefinite insanity (normally taking a few days at the 
Keeper’s discretion), the afflicted person begins to suffer 
from visions of the King in Yellow, which in turn lead to 
a desire to summon the King in Yellow to beg forgiveness 
for using His sign in vain. A kindly Keeper may allow the 
unfortunate wretch a combined Sanity and POW roll to 
see if they can break free of the curse. Ultimately though, 
for most, they become pawns of Hastur, malleable to His 
will and likely to become a permanently insane devotee.
