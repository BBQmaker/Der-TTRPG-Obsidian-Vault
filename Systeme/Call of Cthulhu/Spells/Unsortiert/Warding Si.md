Warding Sign
• Cost:  1 magic point

 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
A special hand gesture that can be performed when 
entering a magically guarded area, such as a tomb or secret 
chamber, to ward off those who guard the location. If 
the signal is made properly, requiring the caster to win 
an opposed POW with the guardian, the caster will be 
ignored. The definition of a guardian is determined by the 
Keeper, but does not include human guards (unless they 
have been magically coerced to guard the place). 
Alternative names: Sign of Kosh, Walk Unseen.
