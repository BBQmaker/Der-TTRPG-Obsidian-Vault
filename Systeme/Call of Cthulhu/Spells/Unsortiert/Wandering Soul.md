Wandering Soul O
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 minutes
Allows the caster to send forth their consciousness (mind’s 
eye, soul, or spirit) to view a location while they sleep or 
meditate. Thus, the caster may scry their enemies and 
view matters far away. Usually a specially prepared drink is 
consumed, although some wizards use mediation to enter 
the proper state required for their consciousness to journey 
outside of their body. 
The dream-like vision reveals information readily 
observable. The caster’s mind cannot interact with what 
is seen in any way—it cannot open boxes or books, and 
so on. The caster must know the location they intend to 
view, or at least must know the approximate area. The 
caster wakes 2D6 hours later with a sense of exhaustion, 
having spent all but one magic point. 
An entity possessing POW 100 or more can see and 
identify the scrying mind while the spell is in effect (the 
consciousness carries the appearance of the caster and 
cannot be disguised), while those with POW 75 or above 
have the uneasy feeling of being watched. 
Alternative names: Travel of Mind’s Eye, Journey to Other 
Places, Spy Thy Enemies and Things Far Off.
