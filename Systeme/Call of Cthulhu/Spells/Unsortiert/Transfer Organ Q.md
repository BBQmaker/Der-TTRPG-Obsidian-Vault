ing time:  1 hour
Permanently replaces any human internal organ with its 
equivalent from another human, with the exception of 
the heart, which it cannot be moved or traded. A living 
donor must be at hand—it is inconsequential whether or 
not the donor agrees to the procedure. If they are aware, 
both donor and recipient should make a Sanity roll (1D8 
loss)—if the donor is unaware of the procedure but later 
learns about their part in it, they lose 1D10 Sanity points. 
A paste is made of blood from both participants, mixed 
with a little chameleon saliva. The donor, receiver, and 
caster are then surrounded by a group who link hands 
and recite an ancient poem: exactly 63 magic points are 
drawn in near equal amounts from each chanter and the 
caster (this energy keeps the subjects alive during the 
procedure). Using the paste, the caster draws a symbol of 
the organ to be transferred on the respective bodies of the 
participants. After an hour of meditation and visualization, 
the caster delves his or her hands into the donor body 
where the symbol is marked. Pinching off major vessels 
and connecting tubes between thumb and forefinger, the 
organ is lifted out and placed on a circular stone table. 
This is repeated for the other person, and then the organ 
is installed in its new body and sewn into place. Whether 
the donor is fortunate enough to have their swapped organs 
replaced (and so being allowed to live) is determined by 
the whim of the caster. Alternative names: Bodily Manipulation, Steal Flesh.
