Golden Cage of Desire B
• Cost:  variable magic points; 5 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1+ day
Turns desire into a trap for the unwary and weak-minded. 
The spell’s target must already be desirous of a particular 
object when the spell is cast. The caster must invest magic 
points equal to number of magic points the target possesses. 
For one day, the target falls into a blissful state, believing 
they have acquired the desired object. The state of bliss can be 
maintained for another day by sacrificing the same number of 
magic points (this, in theory, could be repeated daily). After 
the first 24 hours, and each day thereafter, the target may 
attempt a Hard POW roll in order to come to their senses 
and realize the object is not in their possession. In addition, 
some form of intense violence or significant shock can force 
the target out of the illusion. For each week under this spell, 
the target should make a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss).
Alternative names: Stupefaction of Avarice, Burning Hunger 
of the Heart’s Desire.
