Nightmares (II) C B
• Cost:  10+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 10 minutes per day for 13+ days
This variant of the Nightmare spell causes the target to 
experience their darkest fears as waking hallucinations. 
The caster must obtain elements of the intended target 
(hair, nail clippings, etc..), which are then mixed with herbs 
and ashes and fed back to the target daily for thirteen 
days. Each day, the caster invests 10 magic points. On the thirteenth evening the target experiences waking 
hallucinations for 1D10 minutes which, once started, grow 
stranger and double in length for each additional night that 
the mixture continues to be consumed. The hallucinations 
act like delusions (although they cannot be disbelieved) and 
may cause Sanity loss. If a day and a night passes without 
the feeding, the spell is broken and must be begun afresh. 
Alternative names: Walking Dread, Bring Forth Thy 
Enemies Darkest Horror, Vision of Doom.

Nullify Device M
• Cost : 10 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 4 rounds
Causes one device or tool to fail. The caster must touch the 
item and concentrate for 4 rounds. The item becomes cursed 
and will not perform its originally intended design. The spell 
is effective for small to medium sized items, such as firearms, 
personal computers, simple machines, and tools. For example, 
a cursed wood axe’s handle will most likely snap, or its head 
fly off when used. A cursed firearm will always jam (a roll of 
90–100 causes the weapon to explode, inflicting maximum 
potential damage to the holder and those within 3 feet). The 
curse is not permanent and wears off after 1D10+2 days.
Alternative names: Curse Item, Abolishment of Use, Make 
Thy Tools as Dust.
