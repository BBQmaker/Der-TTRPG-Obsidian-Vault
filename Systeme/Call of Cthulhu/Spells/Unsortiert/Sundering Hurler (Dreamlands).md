Sundering Hurler (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The caster 
must be within 10 yards of the target. A wave of irresistible 
force sweeps the target through the air, depositing it (or 
him or her) more or less gently at a distance equal to 8 
yards per magic point expended. The target lands with 
10% inaccuracy (i.e. for each 100 feet traveled, it is up to 
10 feet off in some direction upon landing). 
Alternative names: Shift, Displacement, Transport.
