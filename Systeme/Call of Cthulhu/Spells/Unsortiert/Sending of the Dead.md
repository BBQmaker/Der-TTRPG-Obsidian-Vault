Sending of the Dead C
• Cost: 10 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
• Casting time: 5 rounds
Causes significant harm or death to the target. The caster 
or supplicant must use something personal to the target in 
casting the spell (hair, toenail clippings, clothing, etc.). The 
personal item is mixed with several handfuls of earth taken 
from a graveyard. The caster must then win an opposed 
POW roll with the target (who may be any distance away). 
The spell performed, the caster or supplicant must now lay 
the enchanted personal item on or in the earth where the 
target will walk on it. If the target does walk over the item, 
the spirits of the dead enter his or her body, causing distress, 
anxiety, mental decay, and possibly physical damage—roll 
1D10 to determine the severity of the spell upon the target:

day thereafter).
10Target collapses and falls into a coma 
lasting 1D6+1 days. On the final day

another spell, or by getting the caster 
to revoke the spell).Opposite: Roots by Goomi

How the spirits of the dead manifest within the target is 
determined by the Keeper; suggestions include the imprint 
of fingers, hands, or faces from within the target’s flesh; black 
“soulless” eyes; the target speaking in strange voices, and so on.
