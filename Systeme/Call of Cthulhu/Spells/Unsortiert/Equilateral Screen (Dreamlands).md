•
 Cast
ing time: several minutes
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Creates 
a complex series of intangible geometric lines in front 
of the caster, formed into a perfect equilateral triangle, 
deep blue in color. The caster can cause images to appear 
by concentrating on the image they wish to create. The 
image appears three-dimensional from a head-on view and 
can be animated, although the image cannot be seen from 
the back, which displays only the geometric lines.  The 
caster may change the image from moment to moment. 
If the caster ceases concentrating, the image fades. If the 
caster fails to concentrate on the screen for five or more 
consecutive minutes, the spell ends.Alternative names: Grand Vistas, Thought Sight.
