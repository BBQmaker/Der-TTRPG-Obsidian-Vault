Free Hastur 9
• Cost:  350 POW
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 minute per point of POW invested
In conjunction with the nine stone monoliths required for 
the Call Hastur spell (page 56), this chant permits Hastur to enter and to remain freely within the area bounded by the 
monoliths. The spell must be cast at night with Aldebaran 
visible. Only the leader of the chant needs to know the 
spell; others involved in the chant lose 1 POW each. 
For every 2 people chanting, 1 POW worth of the 
essence of Hastur or of his spawn gain access to Earth. 
Thus, to bring Hastur (POW 175), requires 350 chanters 
(350 divided by 2 = 175). Note that if the spell, Build 
Carcosa (page 53) is already in place, only 35 chanters are 
required to bring Hastur, with each sacrificing 5 POW each.
Once summoned, Hastur can freely remain; he need not 
return to the sky at sunrise and can remain active all year 
round. Hastur connected spells are usable day or night 
within the bounded region, which can be of any size.
