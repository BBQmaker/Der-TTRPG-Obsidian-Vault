ing time: 7 days
Enchants a necklace that manipulates its wearer. The 
stones to form the necklace are arranged, drilled, cut, and 
polished as the caster desires. The wizard must attune 
the stones by keeping them close to his or her body for 
a week. Once attuned, the wizard performs a series of 
rites as the necklace is constructed. When the stones are 
strung, a blood sacrifice is made over the necklace and 
completes the spell.
Upon coming into possession of the necklace, the target 
makes an opposed POW roll with the wizard: if failed, the 
target effectively becomes devoted to the wizard, seeking 
to be closer to them, and under their sway. With this level 
of control, the wizard is able to impart mental suggestions, 
thereby convincing the target that a particular belief or 
course of action is necessary and vital.
The target is unable to remove the necklace once control 
has been established. To sever the bond a third party must 
remove the necklace, which allows the target to make another 
opposed POW roll with the wizard in order regain their 
self-control. If the target fails the roll, they strongly desire 
to reclaim and wear the necklace. For each 10 hours the 
necklace is not worn, the target may attempt another opposed 
POW roll to negate its effects. Destroying the necklace by 
grinding the stones to dust will also sever the connection, 
but simply breaking the chain will not be enough (the target 
will do all they can to reassemble the necklace).
