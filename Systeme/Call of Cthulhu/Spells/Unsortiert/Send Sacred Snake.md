Send Sacred Snake C
• Cost: 10 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: 4 rounds
Transports a lethal snake to a target’s location. May only 
be cast in an area consecrated to Yig. The target’s actions 
and description must be called out aloud several times 
during the ritual. The spell conveys the snake to the 
target’s current location. On appearing, the snake may 
immediately inflict a surprise attack, which automatically hits (whether the target has the opportunity to notice the 
snake is dependent on their current circumstances and 
the discretion of the Keeper—a kind Keeper might allow 
a Listen, Spot Hidden, or Luck roll to detect the snake). 
If the sacred snake misses, it pursues its victim, striking 
repeatedly. The bite of the sacred snake inflicts 2 damage 
plus poison: the poison is Strong (2D10 damage), causing 
a few minutes of agony and then usually death; an Extreme 
CON roll halves the damage.
The sacred snake is always a huge example of whatever 
type of snake is dominant in the geography of the caster. 
A large white crescent mark can usually be discerned on 
its head. 
Alternative names: Gift of Yig, Yig’s Blessing.
