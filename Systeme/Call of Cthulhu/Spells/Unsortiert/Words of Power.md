Words of Power
• Cost:  3+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•Casting time: 10+ minutes
Creates an intense bond with a large group of listeners. The
caster must speak extemporaneously and seemingly from
the heart, maintaining the audience’s attention. For each
argument, point of view, or command, the caster expends
3 magic points and must make a successful communication
roll as the Keeper thinks appropriate (Charm, Fast Talk, or
Persuade), or the speech ends indecisively and in confusion.
At the end of a successful speech, the audience thoroughly
believes what has been said for 1D3 days.
