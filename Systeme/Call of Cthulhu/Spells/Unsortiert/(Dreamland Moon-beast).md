(Dreamlands/Moon-beast) H
• Cost: 2+ magic points;  1D6 Sanity points
• Casting t
ime: 2 rounds
It is thought that this spell is only known to the moon-
beast priests of Mnomquah. A magical wand blessed by 
Mnomquah is required, which creates a beam of bluish 
light in the form a serpent. This beam will track down its 
target as if by sense of smell. If the intended target is out of 
the caster’s sight, they must know what the target looks like 
in order to cast the spell. A single beam may be directed 
at multiple targets for an additional 2 magic points each. 
The target (human or otherwise) is turned to stone 
when struck by the snake; this is permanent, though use 
of the Dreaming skill can return it to its former state. 
This spell has no effect on stone objects. If the beam is 
somehow severed, the snake will begin to thrash about 
wildly, fade out of existence in one round, and the spell 
will be broken—a target struck by the snake as it fades 
may attempt an opposed POW roll with the caster to avoid 
being turned to stone.
Alternative names: none known.
