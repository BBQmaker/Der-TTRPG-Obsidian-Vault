silvery lines extend from the caster’s hand up to 10 feet 
distant towards a target. The spray cancels out all spells 
in effect upon that target if the magic points in the spray 
are greater than or equal to the total magic points invested 
in all of the spells affecting the target.
Deeper magic: those with a more profound knowledge of 
Cthulhu Mythos are able to affect more than one target—a 
fresh supply of magic points must be used for each target 
(consider the required number of magic points to cancel 
out any spell effect being spent for each target, so the caster 
must be able to draw upon more in order to negate effects 
affecting other targets).
Alternative names: Will of Kuranes, Finger of Nullification.
