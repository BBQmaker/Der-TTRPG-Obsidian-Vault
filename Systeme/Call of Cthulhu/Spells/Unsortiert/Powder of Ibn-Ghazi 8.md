THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
The powder is either blown from a tube or thrown 
over the target. The thing that is dusted stays visible for 
no more than ten heartbeats. That which could be made 
visible includes the magical lines extending from a place 
enchanted for the calling of a Mythos deity, the aura 
around a Gate, and a creature that is normally invisible 
(such as a star vampire). Using the powder costs no Sanity 
points, but seeing what it exposes may provoke such a roll.
Alternative names: Dust of Seeing, Witness of the Unseen, 
Compound of Perception.
