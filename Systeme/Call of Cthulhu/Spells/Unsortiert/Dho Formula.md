Dho Formula O
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 minutes
An ancient magical formula that grants the caster visions 
of distant locales. Certain mantras are recited, with each 
allowing visions of a specific place or time. The caster 
must recite the Dho Formula and then repeats the desired 
mantra (each mantra costs a specific amount of Sanity to 
recite), with overall success determined by a Hard POW 
roll. If successful, the caster is granted a 10-minute vision, 
which can be extended by one minute for each additional 
magic point spent. Note that Sanity losses may be 
accrued for the locale and any entities seen. This spell can 
potentially allow the caster to see into other dimensions 
(like the Dreamlands) or into the past or future of this 
dimension. Visions of the extreme past will not attract the 
attention of the hounds of [[Tindalos]].
A wide range of specific mantras are to be found across 
tomes of the Mythos but, in many, cases these are hidden 
or obscured within the text and may only be discovered 
through a full reading of the tome. Following are some of 
the more common mantras, many others exist:
•
 Mant
ra of the Inner City: a hidden place beneath the 
Earth’s crust (0/1D4 Sanity cost).
•
 Mantra of the Ultimate Gulf: a place in the void 
beyond space and time (1D3/1D8 Sanity cost). 
•
 Mantra of the Sleeper: R’lyeh, the city of Cthulhu 
(1D4/1D8 Sanity cost).
•
 Mantra of the Dreamer: the Dreamlands (0/1D3 Sanity 
cost).
•
 Mantra of the Soul of the Universe: the Court of 
Azathoth (1D10/1D100 Sanity cost).
•
 The Y ellow Mantra: Carcosa, city of Hastur (1D4/1D8 
Sanity cost).

supposedly grants the caster the power to magically travel 
to any place seen through the Dho formula. To date, the 
Hna Formula has remained an enigma; many wizards 
have spent fruitless years pouring over tomes to locate 
the hidden mathematics and vocalizations that form the 
Hna Formula. Some have subsequently stated that the Hna 
Formula is a false path, as it doesn’t actually exist, or that 
it can only be found and used when the Stars Are Right.
