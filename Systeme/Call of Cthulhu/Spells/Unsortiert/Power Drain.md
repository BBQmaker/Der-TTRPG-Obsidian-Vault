Power Drain
• Cost:  1D8 Sanity points
• Casting time: 2 rounds
Leeches magic points from a target. For the spell to take  effect the caster must win an opposed POW roll with the target: if the caster is successful, the target loses 1D6 magic points and the caster gains them; if the caster fails to overcome the target, the caster loses 1D6 magic points to the target. If all magic points are depleted, the spell then drains hit points (if all hit points are drained, the target falls unconscious—this spell lacks the power to kill).
Deeper magic: the thirst for power is most keenly felt by those who delve into dark lore. A proficient wizard may elect to drain POW rather than magic points from a victim.

Alternative names: Leech Lifeforce, Rite of Nyambe, Sup of the Elixir of Power.
