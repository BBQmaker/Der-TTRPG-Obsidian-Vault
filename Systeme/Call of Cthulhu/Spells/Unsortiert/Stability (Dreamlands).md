Stability (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Thin lines 
of energy radiate from the caster’s body, keeping them 
anchored in place—no matter what their surroundings 
are doing. The spell acts as a perfect defense against the 
Living X (page 138) and Sundering Hurler (page 178) 
spells. The caster must expend 6 magic points, enabling 
the spell to remain in action for 1D6+2 rounds; the spell 
can be maintained at a cost of a further 6 magic points for 
another 1D6+2 rounds, and so on. 
The enchantment holds the wizard steady when they 
are in a precarious position. It can even be cast when 
falling from a height, in which case it would suspend the 
caster in space until the spell ended (although, at that point, they would begin falling again). The spell resists 
forcible movement with a STR equal to double the caster’s 
POW—note that if the STR is overcome by other magic 
(i.e. through an opposed roll), the Stability spell cancels 
out and the caster can be moved normally.
Alternative names: Dependable Cohesion, Immovability, 
Preservation of Repose.
