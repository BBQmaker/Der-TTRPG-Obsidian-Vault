Siren’s Song (Folk) 0
• Cost:  6 magic point; 5 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Through an enchanting song or melody the caster beguiles a 
target into believing that the caster is all that his or her heart 
desires. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed 
in an opposed POW roll with the target: if successful, the 
target acts as if completely charmed by the caster—willing 
to act and say as the caster desires. If the target is compelled 
to undertake an action that would inflict harm on another 
whom the caster loves or upon the target him or herself, a 
second opposed POW roll may be called for.
The spell affects all who hear the song, with each person 
affected needing to win an opposed POW roll with the 
caster to be unaffected. The spell’s effect lasts for 1D10 hours.
Alternative names: Glamour, The Mermaid’s Lullaby, Mental 
Receptivity.
