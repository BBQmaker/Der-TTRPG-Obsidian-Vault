Ravening Madness, The (Dreamlands) H
• Cost: 12 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
• Casting time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands and 
normally only at dreamers (visitors to the Dreamlands). 
Causes the target of the spell to suffer a sudden and 
terrible nightmare effect. The target, which must be within 
30 yards of the caster, is forced to make a Sanity roll: if 
failed, they lose 5 Sanity points and immediately suffer 
a Nightmare Effect ( see following). If the Sanity roll is 
successful, the target loses 1D3 Sanity points but suffers 
no further effects. For those already permanently insane 
(zero Sanity) the spell has no effect at all. 
Nightmare Effects 
Choose an effect appropriate to the situation, or roll 1D10 
to randomly determine a nightmare effect.
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
1D10 Nightmare Effect
1An object, item of clothing, or organ melts 
away to nothing, or becomes loathsome or 
horrifying (such as a scimitar becoming a snake 
if the wielder suffered from Ophiophobia). 
The object is restored to normal on the 
character’s next visit to the Dreamlands.
2The character suddenly desires to flee but finds they 
are unable to do so. A hallway seems to stretch on 
infinitely, they are paralyzed, seemingly glued to the 
ground, or they can flee only in excruciatingly slow 
motion. Otherwise, they can do nothing else but 
suffer an intense feeling of dread. The effect ends 
after 1D10+5 rounds.
3Surroundings suddenly melt away, and the 
character finds they have been transported to 
another place—somewhere dark and frightening 
(such as the Dreamland’s Underworld). 
4One of the character’s companions (not 
a dreamer, though), or a nearby plant or 
animal, is transformed into a horrid creature 
of the Keeper’s choosing or design. The 
transformation is reversed upon the dreamer’s 
next visit to the Dreamlands.
5An old wound, injury, disease, or malformation 
suddenly reappears to pain, terrify, and inconvenience. The malady is restored to normal in the dreamer’s next visit to the 
Dreamlands.
6The character wakes (if a dreamer), but no longer 
knows whether they are awake or dreaming. They are disoriented and cannot direct their 
dreaming to a particular person, place, or event 
in the Dreamlands until an amount of time 
chosen by the Keeper passes, or until a successful 
Psychoanalysis roll is made.
7The character makes a Hard INT roll: if failed, 
they wake up immediately, with their hair 
turned grey or white, or beginning to fall out.
8The character makes a Hard POW roll: if failed, 
they wake up immediately and are thereafter 
afflicted by a nervous tic (chosen by the Keeper). 
Depending on its nature, the tic may reduce APP 
by 10 points. Successful Psychoanalysis may, at 
the Keeper’s discretion, reduce or negate the tic.1D10 Nightmare Effect

1D10 Nightmare Effect
9The character makes a Hard CON roll: if 
failed, they wake up and immediately suffer 
a minor coronary arrest—requiring a CON 
roll: if failed, they die. If the roll succeeds, 
they lose 20 CON.
10Any other appropriate effect, as chosen by the 
Keeper. In general, if the dreamer’s real body 
is afflicted, they should be forced awake. If 
only their Dreamlands persona is affected, 
they should have the opportunity to relieve 
any problem, by a successful Dreaming roll and 
the appropriate expenditure of magic points.
