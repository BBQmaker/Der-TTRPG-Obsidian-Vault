on the body housing the soul to be transferred and their 
right hand on the target body. An assistant then murders 
the person whose body is to be stolen; ritually suffocating 
the unfortunate until dead. With the target body’s spirit 
removed, the caster then transfers the soul to its new home, 
which revitalizes the corpse, bringing it to life. 
The soul’s new body will have the INT, EDU, and POW 
of the soul transferred, but all other characteristics are that 
of the donor body. 
Note that investigators attempting this spell must fail a 
Sanity roll in order to perform the act of cold-blooded murder.
