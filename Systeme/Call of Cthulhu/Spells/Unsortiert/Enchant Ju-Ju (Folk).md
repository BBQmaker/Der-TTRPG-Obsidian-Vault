ing time: 1 day
Requires a long ritual which consecrates a personal ward 
(ju-ju) to defend against black magic. The sacrifice of a 
chicken with black feathers is performed during the ritual, 
in which the intended recipient of the ju-ju must take part. 
When created, the ju-ju (an amulet of some kind) will be 
shunned by evil denizens of the voodoo world, sorcerers 
included (those affected cannot come within five feet of 
the ju-ju). The ward can be anything the supplicant wants. 
The ju-ju may be worn to protect a person, or placed over 
a doorway or window to protect a home.
