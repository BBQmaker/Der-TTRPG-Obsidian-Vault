Demon Senses n
• Cost:  5 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 30 minutes
Effectively doubles the caster’s hearing sensitivity or 
visual acuity, bringing sounds twice as close or doubling 
vision magnification. Grants a bonus die to Listen or Spot 
Hidden rolls for 1 hour.
Deeper magic: at the time of casting, the caster may 
increase the magic point expenditure to 10 magic points, allowing the caster to benefit from both enhanced vision 
and hearing. One variation of this spell does not enhance 
sight or hearing, but rather attunes the caster’s extra-
sensory perception, enabling the caster to sense the unseen 
realm of spirit (this may, at the Keeper’s discretion, include 
awareness of invisible non-terrestrial entities).
Alternative names: Sight of the Eagle, Smile of the Predator, 
P’Kan’s Acuity.
