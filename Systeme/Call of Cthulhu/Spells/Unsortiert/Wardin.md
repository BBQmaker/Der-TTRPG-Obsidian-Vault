• Cost:  1 magic point per stone

 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
A number of ordinary white stones are placed on the 
ground as the caster pleases, except that each must be 
within a yard of one another. When cast, a shimmering 
heat haze can be seen over the stones. Thereafter if any 
stone is moved or touched, the caster will be aware of the 
fact, even if asleep until then. Once this has occurred, the 
spell is broken.
Alternative names: Stones of Safekeeping, Leave Thy Burden 
to the Rock, Circle of Protection.
