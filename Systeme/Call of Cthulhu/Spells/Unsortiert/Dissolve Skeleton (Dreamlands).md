Dissolve Skeleton (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  8 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Losing 
an opposed POW roll with the caster, the target’s bones 
vanish. The target collapses on the floor: a heap of folded, 
quivering flesh, provoking a Sanity roll (1D20/1D20+5 
loss). The victim might asphyxiate, lacking structure with which to keep the air passage clear, or the other 
investigators might be content with toting around their 
jelly-like friend in a hand-basket. At the Keeper’s option, 
a successful Dreaming roll (or another spell) might restore 
the victim’s bones. Witnessing this dissolution calls for a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss).
Alternative names: Liquefy Bones, Touch of the Worm, The 
Obscene Oozing.
