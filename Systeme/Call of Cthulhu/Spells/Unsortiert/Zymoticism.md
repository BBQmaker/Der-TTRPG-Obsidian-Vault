Zymoticism
• Cost:  4+ magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1+ round
Unleashes a malicious fungal infection, which controls the 
actions of the target and, ultimately, their death. The spell 
requires the caster to gather an assortment of fungi, which 
are used in the preparation of a paste. The caster ritually stirs 
the paste while reciting the names of the one hundred dark 
young of Shub-Niggurath and also concentrates on a single 
action he or she wishes the target(s) of the spell to perform. 
Once finished, the caster may use the paste to infect one or 
more targets. The spell creates enough paste for four doses.
Infection may be brought about through ingestion 
or prolonged contact (at least 4 rounds). Note that the 
caster is immune to the infection when coating another’s 
skin with the paste. The paste is a pale white in color and odorless if used in food; otherwise, it looks like a 
thin porridge. If one dose is used, the target may make a 
combined CON and POW roll to resist the spell’s effects.

If the dose is doubled for one target, the combined roll is 
at Hard difficulty; if tripled, the difficulty is increased to 
Extreme. If four doses are combined for a single individual 
the spell is automatically successful. Naturally, the caster 
will have to coat the paste over the target’s body for 
applications exceedingly one dose—requiring the target 
to be unconscious or compliant.
Once the target is infected, the magical fungus begins 
to grow and take over their body. The rate of growth 
and control is illustrated below, although a Keeper may accelerate the process if so desired. Within days, the fungus controls the target’s actions, implanting an 
irresistible urge to undertake whatever course of action the caster had preordained when preparing the spell. Such 
commands could include finding an item and bringing 
it to the caster, finding and killing a person, and so on. 
Implanted commands may be triggered to occur only at a 
certain time and date. The longer the infection, the more 
zombie-like the target becomes as their mind and body 
are consumed. Whether the target is able to carry out the 
command or not, he or she eventually dies, fully consumed 
by the fungus. In time, the fungus decays into nothingness, 
leaving behind the twisted and gnarled bones of the target.
