(Mythos Deities/Very Powerful Sorcerers)
• Cost:  n/a 
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
A version of the Gate spell (page 120),  which is kept open 
entirely by the will (minimum POW 125) of a god or great 
sorcerer, and operated by him, her, or it. The cost for creation is 
beyond the capability of investigators and the rest of humanity.
In this version, the energizing magic points come from 
the deity or sorcerer, not from those who actually use the 
window—the personal POW of the traveler does not limit the distance traveled by the user. As the creator wishes, 
no sign or symbol necessarily marks the exit or entrance, 
which may open and close at the creator’s will. A Gate 
Window may be one-way or two-way, as the caster wishes.
Alternative names: none known.
