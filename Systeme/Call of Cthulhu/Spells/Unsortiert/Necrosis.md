ing time: 1 round
An evil curse causing a target’s hand to necrotize, and may 
lead to death. The caster speaks aloud the spell, calling upon 
deities of the Mythos to strike down those who oppose the 
caster’s will. The spell’s target must be visible to the caster. 
The spell’s effect is delayed, only beginning to manifest 1D4 
days afterward at which point the target begins to suffer 
a tingling in one of their hands. Each day thereafter the 
target’s hand steadily begins to necrotize—the flesh dying 
and becoming gangrenous. Unchecked, the necrosis begins 
to work its way up the arm and into the body. The rate of expansion means that the necrotizing process reaches past 
their arm and into their body after 6 days. Each day the 
target loses 1 hit point, with the horrific “injury” accelerating 
to 1D4 damage per day after 6 days (possibly accelerating 
further as the Keeper sees fit) until death. No treatment 
other than amputation (cutting off the cursed hand or arm) 
is viable or effective. Amputation becomes ineffective if the 
curse reaches past the arm into the body, where only magical 
means (if it can be found) will halt the curse.
Deeper magic: certain powerful sorcerers have been 
recorded as using this spell at their death to curse their 
enemy from beyond the grave. In such instances, should the 
sorcerer be depleted of magic points, a sacrifice of 10 POW 
may activate the spell. In addition, the dying sorcerer could 
sacrifice multiples of 10 POW to curse multiple individuals.
