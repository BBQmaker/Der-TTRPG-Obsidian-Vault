Quicken the Voice of the Deep
• Cost: variable magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1 hour
Magically hastens a deep one hybrid’s
transformation from semi-human to full deep
one, thus shortening the decades-long process
to weeks, days, or even hours. The spell must be
cast at night, on or within sight of the ocean.
The hybrid to be transformed should be present,
or the caster must have a magical connection
with the target—hair, blood, a personal
possession (a photograph may be enough).
The caster sacrifices as many magic points as
desired, and may also call on any number of
assistants, who can each lend a maximum of
2 magic points. If the ritual gathers a total of
20 magic points, the target will transform in
a single year; if 40 magic points are gathered,
the transformation takes 2D6 months; if 80+
points are invested, the transformation will be complete in 1D100 hours.
Such a rapid transformation will take its toll:
excessive Sanity point losses are to be expected,
and this very rapid transition might prove fatal
to the spell’s target.
Alternative names: Dagon’s Call, Song of Hydra,
Birthing Song.

FOG SPAWN
Other Dimensional Life Form
Know it by the stench of burning hair that emanates from its soulless heart.
Know it by its lack of physicality for it passes unseen and likens to dark places
to hunt its prey. Not of this world, it hungers and waits, shrouded in mist
to catch the unwary and choke the very life from those without sense to run.

Fighting: inserts pliable tentacles into nostrils and mouth of the
target—up to six victims simultaneously—inflicting choking damage,
which increases each round: 1 damage in first round, 2 damage in
second round, 3 damage in third round, and so on. If the target is able
to win an opposed STR roll versus the STR of the tentacles, he or
she may break free and escape. Each tentacle has STR 25, multiplied
by the number of tentacles attacking the individual; thus, if the Thing
performs three successful attacks on one target, the opposed roll is
versus STR 75, and so on.
Investigators suffer a penalty die to all attempts to hit the monster
(they must essentially make wild attacks) and fumbles mean they have
hit an ally or the Thing’s victim instead.
Insubstantial: immune to physical attacks. It may be seen
(momentarily) in bright light as a sparkling gray cloud with thin,
whip-like tentacles. Direct sunlight dispels the fog-spawn back to
its native dimension (transition takes ten minutes), from whence it
cannot return.  If it can find a perpetually dark place, such as a deep
sewer or a cave, the fog-spawn might stay on Earth for some time.
It is immortal in Earthly terms, with no need to feed. Its motives or
instincts are unknown.
Armor*: none—the fog-spawn is insubstantial and nothing material
can harm it. Bright light can drive it away but does not actually harm it.
Skills: Hunt for Victim 65%, Stealth 95%.
Sanity Loss: if seen, 1/1D10. Automatically lose 1D8 points upon the
fog-spawn’s first successful attack.
