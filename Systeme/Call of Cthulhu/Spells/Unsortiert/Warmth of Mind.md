Warmth of Mind 2
• Cost:  2+ magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Increases the body temperature of the caster, providing 
protection from the cold. The spell takes the form of a 
repeating mental chant, which slowly increases internal 
temperature and negates the effects of hyperthermia, 
freezing, and other cold based discomforts. For every 2 magic points spent, the caster may maintain their 
temperature at a normal level for one hour.
Allegedly, the Tibetan meditative practice known as 
“Tummo” (where practitioners can generate body heat through 
meditation) is considered some derivation of this spell.
Deeper magic: in the hands of a powerful Mythos wizard, 
this spell can be taken to frightening heights. Rather than 
maintaining body temperature at normal levels, the caster may 
increase their temperature to such an extent that combustible 
materials (including the caster’s clothes) are ignited by touch, 
and the flesh of others is burned (if successful in combat, the 
caster’s hands cause 1D6+1 damage). This greater effect costs 
2 magic points per round to maintain.
Alternative names:  Cthugha’s Rebuke, Word of Flame, Touch 
of Ra.
