 Mind Exchange n
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Allows the spellcaster to trade minds with another 
individual. The caster must expend magic points equal 
to one-fifth of the target’s POW the first time the spell 
is cast. Thereafter, for the same targeted individual, the 
cost reduces by 1 magic point per casting until it reaches 
1, where it remains. The target must know the spellcaster 
and a significant emotional bond must exist between them 
(e.g. love). If that affection is somehow lost, the exchange 
can no longer occur. Fresh affection renews the chance. 
This spell may be cast at any range. When cast, the 
caster must win an opposed POW with the target to 
perform the exchange (the more times the spell is cast, the 
easier it becomes to exchange minds, hence the reducing 
cost of the spell (per the terms stated above). When the 
cost has been reduced to 1 magic point the opposed POW 
roll is no longer necessary and the caster can transfer at 
will, using only a strong mental effort. 
 The spellcaster cannot initially stay more than a few 
minutes inside the target’s body, but progressively (with 
repeated use of the spell) is able to stay longer and longer. 
Once the cost for transfer is 1 magic point, he or she can 
stay there indefinitely as desired.
Note that for the person who mind has been exchanged 
into the caster’s body, a Sanity roll is required (1/1D3 or 
more depending on the circumstances).
Deeper magic: by effectively doubling the magic point 
cost of the spell the caster swops the minds of two other 
individuals. An emotional bond is not necessarily required, 
but both individuals must be in the same location (within 
20 feet of one another and the caster). The caster must 
spend magic points equal to one-fifth of each of the target’s 
POW (this cost never diminishes through repeated casting). 
The duration is variable, usually 1D10+10 minutes, but may 
be longer at the Keeper’s discretion. Reversing the casting 
returns the minds to their correct bodies.
