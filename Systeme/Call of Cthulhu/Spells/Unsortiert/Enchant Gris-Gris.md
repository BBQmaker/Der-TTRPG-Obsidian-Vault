Temporarily grants a skill enhancement to the owner of 
the gris-gris bag. A leather pouch is filled with various 
ingredients, including hair, skin, and blood of the intended 
owner. A small animal must be sacrificed. The caster 
invests the pouch with 10 magic points, while the intended 
owner sacrifices 5 POW, 1D4 Sanity points, and a variable 
number of magic points.  For each magic point sacrificed 
by the owner when the gris-gris is made, he or she gains 
+1 percentile in a particular skill (except Cthulhu Mythos) 
when wearing the pouch. The pouch will grant the benefit 
for a maximum of 1D100+1 days.
