ing time: instantaneous
Allows the caster to vocalize their thoughts and have 
them originate from another source in their immediate 
area (within 20 feet) other than their own mouth. Every 
four sentences cost 1 magic point and 1 Sanity point. 
Often used to distract or confuse an opponent; the target 
might be required to succeed with a Hard INT roll or be 
distracted by the voice (possibly suffering a penalty die to 
their next action if in combat or an otherwise tense situation). 
Alternative names: Silent Articulation, Vocal Mask.
