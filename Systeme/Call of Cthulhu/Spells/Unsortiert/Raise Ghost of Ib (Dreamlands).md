Raise Ghost of Ib (Dreamlands) H
• Cost: variable magic points
• Casting time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. In 
ancient times the beings of Ib worshiped the Great Old 
One Bokrug until the people of Sarnath laid waste to 
Ib. The caster calls upon the ghosts of Ib to come forth 
and materialize. The spell raises one ghost being of Ib 
per magic point invested. There is no Sanity cost for the 
spell, but the creatures themselves prompt Sanity rolls of their own.  
This spell is normally only effective when cast on the 
shores of the Nameless Lake, near the ruins of Sarnath 
or Ib. Yet, if Bokrug is somehow present when the caster 
begins this spell, ghost-beings of Ib can be summoned 
anywhere in the Dreamlands. Furthermore, when Bokrug 
is present, 1D10 Ghost-Beings of Ib are summoned per 
magic point spent.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Beings from Ib.
Alternative names: Manifest Bokrug’s Favored Ones, Call 
the Doom of Sarnath.
