Remortification 8 O
• Cost:  1D6+1 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Forces the appearance of the ghost (spirit/essence) of a 
deceased person. The spell must either be cast over the 
grave of the deceased or where the person died. The spirit 
re-enacts the movements made just before its death. The 
spirit is immaterial, yet (if appropriate) vocalized sound 
may be heard—although the spirit cannot hear or perceive 
the caster; thus, it cannot answer questions. Objects pass 
right through it. It cannot physically harm anyone or 
anything, but may cost Sanity points to see.
Alternative names: Summon Spirits of the Dead, Witness the 
Dying Stroke, Call Up Those Past.
