Touch of Decay 6 e
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Causes objects touched by the caster to rapidly age. The 
caster channels the power of Tulzscha, which has the effect 
of covering one of the caster’s hands in glowing green 
flame. If targeting an inanimate object, the object ages 10 
years for every magic point invested. This aging is so rapid 
that it has dire effects on the object, as if it was aging in 
the worst of possible conditions: wood warps, metal rusts, 
stone crumbles, glass shatters, but plastic and rubber are 
immune to the effect. 
The amount of time required to rot away a specific item 
is determined by its constituent material; for example, a 
doorknob will break in 40 years, wooden boards will rot 
in 70 years, bricks will crumble in 100 years, and an iron 
bar will snap in 140 years (at the discretion of the Keeper).
If this spell is used on a living being, multiply the 
amount of magic points invested by five, using this value 
in an opposed roll versus the target’s POW. If the caster 
succeeds, the target will rapidly age five years for every 
magic point spent. In addition, the target loses 5 points 
from a random characteristic for every 5 years of aging: roll 
1D4 to determine the affected stat: 1 = STR; 2 = DEX; 3 
= CON; and 4 = APP . s

THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Once the spell is cast, it remains in effect until the 
caster chooses to end it. While the spell remains, each 
round the spell consumes 1 magic point and whatever 
the caster touches ages 10 years (5 for living things)—the 
caster may invest more magic points per round (which 
should be declared upon their action). Once magic points 
are depleted, hit points are burned instead, which could 
cause the death of the caster if they, for some reason, are 
unable to cease the spell.

Entropy’s Gift.
