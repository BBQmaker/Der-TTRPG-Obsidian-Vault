ing time: 6+ days
Creates a set of three magical bells used to summon the 
little-known Great Old One, Zu-Che-Quon. Each bell 
must be fashioned in bronze and inscribed inside with 
sigils relating to Zu-Che-Quon. These bells must be cast 
while the proper rites are chanted (bells already existing 
cannot be enchanted). The size of the bells may vary, 
but each must be large, at least SIZ 35. To conclude the spell, the caster’s life force must enchant each bell with 10 
POW and 1D6 Sanity points. Once created, the bells of 
horror may be used by anyone and at any time to summon 
Zu-Che-Quon (see Call Zu-Che-Quon, page 60).
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Zu-Che-Quon.
