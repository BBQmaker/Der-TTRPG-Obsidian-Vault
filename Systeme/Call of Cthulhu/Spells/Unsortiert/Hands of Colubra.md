Hands of Colubra 6
• Cost:  12 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Transforms the hands of the caster into the foreparts of 
two venomous snakes. The spell only affects the caster, with 
the effect lasting 1D3+3 rounds. The transformed snakes 
can bite targets up to 8 feet distant. Those viewing the 
transformed wizard should make a Sanity roll (0/1D6 loss).
Each snake may attack (using the caster’s Fighting 
skill), with each bite delivering 1D3 damage plus injecting 
venom—if the target fails to make an Extreme CON roll, 
the venom causes the loss of 1D10 hit points per round 
until the hit points lost equal one-fifth of the caster’s POW 
or the target is dead. 
Alternative names: The Serpent’s Fingers, The Blessing of Yig.

Healing (Folk) 0

 Cast
ing time: 2D6 rounds
This spell provides healing to physical injuries. The caster 
must touch the injured person whilst repeating a short 
phrase. In some variations of the spell, preparation of certain 
ingredients (healing herbs, oils, etc.) must also be applied.Once the spell has been invoked, the healing process is 
accelerated: after 2D6 rounds the injured person is healed 
for 2D6 hit points (up to normal maximum hit points). 
The spell does not actually regenerate flesh, but rather it 
melds wounds together, leaving awful scars that may reduce 
APP (and possibly other lasting physical ailments at the 
Keeper’s discretion). The healing is only permanent if the 
caster also spends 1 POW per hit point healed; otherwise 
the healing is temporary and the wounds reopen after a 
day. Note that this spell cannot bring back the dead to life. 
Deeper magic: a variant of the spell may mentally heal a 
person, allowing the target to regain 2D6 Sanity points and 
curing any insanity currently suffered. Again, the effects 
are temporary (24 hours) unless the cater sacrifices 1 POW 
per Sanity point regained.
Alternative names: Impart Nourishment to the Ailing Flesh, 
The Blessing, Meld Wounds.
