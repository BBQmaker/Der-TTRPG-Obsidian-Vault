 Cast
ing time: 1 day 
Requires a human corpse, which retains sufficient flesh to 
allow mobility after activation. The caster puts an ounce of 
his or her own blood in the mouth of the corpse, then kisses 
the lips of the corpse and “breathes part of the self ” into 
the body. Five points of POW are lost, a gift to the corpse. s

With success, the caster may give the zombie simple 
commands that it will carry out. Over time the zombie 
may learn to accept more complex commands. Should the 
caster die, the zombie becomes inactive and rots away. The 
zombie will last until it eventually falls apart (this could 
take years). Part of the invocation refers collectively to 
the Mythos Gods—though no specific names are used. 
Alternative names: Everlasting Servant, Blood of Life.
