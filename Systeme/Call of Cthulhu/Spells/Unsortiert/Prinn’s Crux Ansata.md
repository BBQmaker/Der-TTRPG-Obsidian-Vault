Prinn’s Crux Ansata 8
• Cost:  25 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: variable days 
Creates an ankh (looped cross) that can temporarily or 
permanently banish individual Mythos creatures. The object must be an ankh made of an unalloyed metal—
pure copper, iron, silver, gold, or lead would be the easiest 
metals to find and to form. For 20 minus a number of days equal to one-fifth of the caster’s INT the caster 
performs episodic rites and sacrifices, and then sacrifices 
the necessary POW to enchant the ankh. 
To combat a Mythos creature, the caster intones a chant 
for three rounds and expends any number of magic points. 
Companions of the caster may contribute 1 magic point each; 
as a consequence of the 25 POW already sacrificed, the caster 
adds 5 “free” magic points as well. For the spell to take effect 
the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the 
target. If the number of magic points gathered is equal to 
or greater than one-fifth of target’s POW the caster gains a 
bonus die in the opposed POW roll; in addition, the caster 
may challenge a being with POW equal to his or hers plus 200.Opposite: Pentragram of Chaos by Goomis

Any person who knows the chant (but not the spell) 
may wield the ankh and attempt to banish a creature, but 
they do not receive the 5 magic points increase granted 
to the original caster. 
If the ankh-wielder and companions overcome the 
creature, it is dispelled. If they fail to dispel the thing, it 
attacks the ankh-wielder first before turning its attention 
to others present.

Expulsion.
