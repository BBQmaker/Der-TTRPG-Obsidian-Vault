Unseen, The Wizard’s Trap.Gate Boxes
• Cost: variable magic points; 5 POW; variable Sanity 
points
• Casting t
ime: 5+ hours
Allows the creation of twin magical boxes that form two ends 
of a magical Gate. Going through a  Gate box costs exactly 
the same magic points and Sanity points as going through 
a normal Gate and the transit procedure is the same—see 
Table 1: Gate Creation and Travel Costs, page 122.
To create the Gate boxes, two identical wooden boxes 
are constructed to any desired SIZ. The boxes should open 
only at one end. The necessary ritual, consisting of placing 
one’s hands on the boxes and conceiving certain hyper-
dimensional lines and angles in one’s mind for about five 
hours must be performed (5 POW is sacrificed at this time). 
Then the boxes automatically drain half the creator’s magic 
points each day, until they have absorbed magic points equal 
to their total SIZ × 20. 1 Sanity point is lost for every full 
week of magic point drain. Once the necessary magic points 
have been taken, the boxes become operational.
Deeper magic: see Vanish (page 183) for a variant use 
for Gate Boxes.
Alternative names: Enchant Gate Boxes, Vanish, Bodily 
Evaporation.
