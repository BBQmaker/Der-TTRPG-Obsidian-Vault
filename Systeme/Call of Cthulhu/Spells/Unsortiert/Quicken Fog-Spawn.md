Quicken Fog-Spawn 7
• Cost:  25 magic points; 10 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
The spell requires the larva of an other-dimensional 
Mythos entity (sometime known as “Gish-rla” but which 
has many conflicting names). The spell must be cast within 
dense fog through which no bright light can penetrate. A 
drop of the caster’s blood must be smeared on the larva, 
and the spell’s cost paid.
The spell causes the invisible, entity (“fog-spawn”) to 
rapidly grow. The creature may be mentally commanded by 
the caster to move in any direction and to act as the caster 
chooses (usually it is directed to kill as the creature has 
limited mental faculties). The caster must remain within 
200 feet of the Thing or it will go free; the caster can sense 
its approximate location while it is under his or her control. 
Control lasts for three hours, or until the fog lifts or day 
breaks (it will flee if faced with bright light, and direct 

THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
sunlight dispels the creature). After three hours, 
the creature will wander aimlessly through the 
night, killing those it catches before either 
disappearing from whence it came or perhaps 
finding a place of darkness to lurk in.
Alternative names: Rite of Rebirth,  
Transmogrify Spawn of Nether Realms.
