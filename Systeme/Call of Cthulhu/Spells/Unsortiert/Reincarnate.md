Reincarnate O
• Cost:  10 magic points; 10 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1D10+20 minutes
Recreates a dead person from memory. The caster 
concentrates their mind upon the person, who must have 
been personally known to them, for 1D10 +20 minutes 
to “reincarnate” them. The reincarnated person manifests 
before the caster as if physically alive and remains, able 
to talk and answer questions, move about, and so on, for 
up to 5 minutes. The spell may be recast instantaneously 
for the same cost, although this must happen immediately 
in the same round as the original spell ceases, otherwise 
the caster must again spend 1D10+20 minutes mentally 
concentrating. The recreated being possesses all the 
idiosyncrasies of the original.
Alternative names: Memory Transmigration, Restoration of 
Thought, Call Forth Divine Friend.
