a target area, which can be up to 30 yards away and up to 
3 yards in diameter. Everything in the path of the breeze

•
 Description: thin, somewhat gaunt 
face, piercing eyes.
•
 Ideolog
y: knowledge is power.
•
 Traits: secretive, inquisitiveness, blind 
pursuit of magical knowledge.
Born in Skaerbaek, Denmark, Schou is a veteran of the Great War trenches. 
He was drafted by German forces, who 
occupied southern Denmark, and spent 
the war working as an engineer. While he 
kept life and limb together, his mind was 
immeasurably weakened. Despite such trauma, Schou’s service allowed him to visit the forgotten medieval hamlets of 
France where he lost himself in dusty old 
tomes of antiquity. What he learned in 
those books enabled him to sustain his life 
in spite of the mortal dangers around him.
After the war, Schou moved to 
America where he began to research and compile magical incantations; 
meticulously translating, transcribing—
and testing—those he found interesting. 
This work soon became a mania, a way to 
preserve these magical rites for posterity. 
This work has taken a toll, although his 
cloistered lifestyle tends to hide this from 
those closest to him. Slowly, he is being 
“converted” into something akin to a 
living grimoire, with his mind (unknown 
to him) being a repository for spells far 
darker than he realizes. Nowadays he spends most of his 
days in a small garret apartment near Miskatonic University—where he 
works as a part-time archivist, making 
use of the various libraries to further his 
studies. Those around him are unaware 
of the secrets he holds and the power 
he can wield.
Schou views magic like that of a man 
saved from drowning by the hand of his 
savior. His willful pursuit of knowledge 
has made him blind to the inherent 
danger—he remains sublimely unaware 
of the threat he faces. Ultimately, he is 
ignorantly grooming himself to become 
a portal for a fearsome Mythos entity 
(as yet unspecified). Perhaps one day 
soon his inquisitiveness may open up 
a new vista of understanding, a new 
perspective, which may provoke him into 
realizing the danger he faces. Perhaps 
then he will seek the help of others. In 
the meantime, he could be a remarkable 
resource for any investigators wishing 
to learn about magic (and possibly a 
handy spell or two). The only price he 
charges being that the investigators must 
commit the spell to memory.

left to the Keeper to determine if a frozen person remains 
alive (able to be thawed out) or whether they are dead.
