 Cast
ing time: 3 weeks
The tablet required for this spell must be made from black 
stone taken from the sunken city of R’lyeh. It must be 
carefully etched over a period of three weeks, the caster 
investing 1 magic point each day while carving. When 
complete, both a deep one and a human must be sacrificed 
to the tablet without shedding blood (usually by strangling 
or smothering). When finished, the stone is enchanted.Anyone possessing the tablet suffers nightmares of alien 
vistas and dimly perceived oozing masses, all against a 
background of shifting colors and forms. Far-off, slithering 
and gurgling can be heard. If the stone’s possessor destroys 
the tablet, the effects of the dreams intensify, with the 
same result as if the spell Curse of the Stone ( page 92) 
had been cast upon the owner (except that he or she does 
not fall prey to instant hallucinations).
If the tablet is tossed into the sea, it Contacts (but 
does not Bind) 1D8 deep ones. They return the tablet to 
the person who threw it. The time it takes the deep ones 
to bring back the tablet depends on the distance of the 
thrown tablet to the nearest deep one city. The dreams stop 
while the deep ones possess the tablet. Otherwise, the only 
sure means to stop the nightmares is to gift the tablet to 
another (must physically hand it to a receptive person), or 
deface the stone with an Elder Sign (page 105).
