Song of Glissande (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  variable magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. It produces 
a tiny huddle of silver needles just above the caster’s 
outstretched palm; these play a sweetly chiming melody 
that lingers in the air for 1D6+1 rounds, echoing dreamily 
away. The number of magic points invested by the caster 
are multiplied by five for an opposed rolled against the 
INT of the intended target(s), who must be able to both 
see and hear the needles (be within 20 feet). If the target 
loses the opposed roll they are peacefully engrossed for 
the song’s duration. After the first round, the caster may move away and the needles remain floating in place, fading 
slowly away. Anyone happening across the chimes while 
they play must attempt the same opposed roll. If a person 
engrossed by the chimes is shaken roughly or injured, they immediately snap out of their trance. This spell 
has numerous uses—slipping a few people past a guard, 
avoiding being mauled by a savage beast, or getting out of a 
fight with drunken sailors are just three possible examples.
Alternative names: Enthralling Melody, Chimes of 
Distraction, Mollification.
