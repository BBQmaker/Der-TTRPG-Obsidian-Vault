Evil Eye C B
• Cost:  10 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Causes a target to suffer from bad luck. While the target
must be within sight of the caster, he or she will not
necessarily sense the Evil Eye’s influence, but is likely
to feel an odd chill or unease when the spell is first cast.s

With a successful casting, the target’s chance for a Luck
roll is halved*. The target must apply one penalty die to all
characteristic and skill rolls, his or her guns jam on every
roll of 75% or higher, melee weapons break on a roll of 75%
or higher, and the chance to successfully cast a Summon/
Bind spell is halved. The effects continue until the next
sunrise, until the caster removes the spell, until the caster is
found and blooded (hit hard enough to bleed), or until the
target dies. This spell may also be countered by Warding
the Eye ( page 188).
*Neither can the target spend or gain luck points if the Optional
Luck Rule is being used.
Deeper magic: those able to call upon the greater wisdom
and knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos may direct this
spell at a group (up to five individuals) who must all be in
the sight of the caster.
