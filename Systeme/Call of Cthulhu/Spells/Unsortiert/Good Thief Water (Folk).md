 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
A spell to prevent the theft of the caster’s property. The 
caster prepares an infusion of various ingredients and then 
sprinkles a bit of the infusion on an item. Anyone attempting 
to steal that item will have make an Extreme POW roll to 
still be willing to do so. Otherwise, the would-be thief has 
an inexplicable and strong aversion to the item, and a slight 
nausea when contemplating the theft. The effect lasts for 
1D6+1 days. One batch of the infusion is enough to protect 
goods equivalent in size to an average automobile.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Art/Craft 
(Potions) roll may be needed to ensure that directions are 
carefully followed.
Deeper magic: with an increased cost of 10 magic points 
and 1D4+4 Sanity points, the infusion becomes much more 
potent (the amount of the liquid is reduced, creating enough 
to apply to four items at most). When sprinkled on an item it 
causes the would-be thief to suffer convulsions when in close 
proximity; the thief must make a CON roll or be unable to do 
little more than writhe on the ground until such time as they 
are carried away or the item is removed from their presence. 
Alternative names: Thief Bane, Hideous Retching, Curse of 
the Pilfering Hand.
