Emerald Darts of Ptath (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  4+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The spell 
creates one dart per 4 magic points sacrificed. When used  
against another, the dart produces an unnatural green light 
and shoots up to a hundred yards toward its target, causing 
1D3 damage to the target and ignoring all armor (natural or 
otherwise). The target may attempt to dive for cover (Dodge 
roll) to avoid a dart attack. May be used to harmlessly 
explode the Lavender Spheres of Ptath (page 135).
Deeper magic: at a cost of 8 magic points per dart, the 
damage caused is increased to 1D6.
Alternative names: Devil Darts, Bolts of Emerald Doom.
