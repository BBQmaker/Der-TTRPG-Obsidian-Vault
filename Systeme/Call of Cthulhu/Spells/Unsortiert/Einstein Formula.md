Einstein Formula 2
• Cost:  10 magic points; 5 POW; 10 Sanity points
• Casting time: 6 rounds
A dangerous variant of Call Yog-Sothoth ( page 60)
intended to summon the Outer God’s spherical forces
as a means of protection. The spell takes the form of a
complex mathematical formula combined with a ritual.
A chalk circle is drawn on the ground, in which the
caster stands. The mind of the caster focuses on specific
numerical formulas (concerning extrapolations of spheres
and spherical sections in various hyper-dimensions) as the
ritual is carried out.
With success, unearthly forces are unleashed (STR 50+
wind in a 30-foot radius; the caster is unaffected). Multi-
colored spheres begin to bubble out of the ether around the
caster (provoking Sanity rolls for those witnessing; 1/1D4
loss). The caster may decide to resist the magical process
at this point with a successful POW roll to snap out of
what is to come (doing this stops the spell). Thereafter,
the chalk circle “rises” into the air and spins around the
caster (and up three other average humans) to at an ever-
increasing rate of speed, like a gyroscopic hula-hoop,
forming a chronal energy sphere in the process.
No hounds of [[Tindalos]] may pass this barrier as
attempting to do so, each such creature loses 1D8 hit
points and is banished back to Tindalos. The Lords of
Tindalos may be repulsed at first; however, it is believed
that some are able to break the barrier—the truth of this
is up for debate.
Once the spell is fully enacted, the caster can extend
the spell by one round if a successful INT roll is made.
Otherwise, the spell normally lasts for 1D4+1 rounds. The
caster can move while maintaining the sphere, so long as
they make an INT roll for each round that they do so (thus,
if extending the spell’s duration and moving at the same
time, a Hard INT roll is required). A failed roll ends the
spell and causes the sphere to dissipate. While maintaining
the sphere, the caster cannot engage in any other action
more complicated than moving about.
Those (apart from the caster) who go insane while inside
the sphere begin to float off the ground, hovering, eyes
glowing with raw cosmic power for the next 2D4 rounds.
They also lose an automatic 1 Sanity point per round, as their
mind becomes a conduit for Mythos. When this is over, they
gain Cthulhu Mythos skill points to the value of the Sanity
points lost (e.g. Professor Conlon goes temporarily insane
from seeing [[hounds of Tindalos]] while inside the sphere,
he becomes a Mythos conduit for 5 rounds, and so loses 5
Sanity points but gains 5 Cthulhu Mythos).Should the caster go insane while performing the
spell, he or she becomes an avatar of Yog-Sothoth for 2D4 rounds: they transform into a mass of bubbles
(those witnessing the transformation make a Sanity roll;
1D10/1D100 loss). If any Tindalosians are within the
avatar’s presence, they are forced back to Tindalos. In any
case, at the end of the period, the avatar departs—the
caster is gone, but in a final moment of clarity before their
dissolution, he or she comprehends the fundamental forces
of time and space.
Note: to learn this highly mathematical spell, the person must
have at least 40% in the Science (Mathematics or Physics)
skill, as well as passing the standard requirements for spell
learning and casting.
