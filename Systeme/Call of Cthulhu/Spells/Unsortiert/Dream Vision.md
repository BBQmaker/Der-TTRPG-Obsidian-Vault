ing time: 1 hour
Brings forth dreams or nightmares portending to the 
future. May be cast upon the wizard him or herself, or 
at a chosen target (the wizard must be able to see the 
target). The spell may involve the ingestion of certain hallucinogenic plants or compounds. The dreams are 
unusually vivid, although the information related is usually 
cryptic and metaphorical in nature and imagery—may also 
cost Sanity points, depending on the content of the dream.
Alternative names: Vision Sleep, Slumber of the Unwise, 
Scrying at the Door of Nightmares to Come.
