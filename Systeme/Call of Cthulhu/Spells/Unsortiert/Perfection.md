ing time: 24 hours
Given the permission of a Mythos deity, the caster
may convert points of POW into points of other
characteristics (or vice versa), either for the caster or for
his or her designated target. The deity designates any costs
involved—usually one for one in characteristic points. There is no Sanity charge per se, but contact with an
Outer God or Great Old One is necessary, so the Sanity
loss involved may be substantial. The conversion of points
lasts for 1 week.
Deeper magic: well-favored servants of Mythos deities may
be granted greater boons, with the change in characteristics
lasting for greater lengths of time (1 month or 1 year perhaps). Opposite: Sigil of Cthulhu by Goomis 

Another variant might grant the caster the ability to drain
characteristic points from a victim and inflate their own
corresponding characteristic (like-for-like for any characteristic,
except for POW) for a set amount of time (suggest 1 month);
although, such a variant would cost the caster at least 1D8
Sanity points and they would have to win an opposed POW
roll with the victim for the spell to be successful.

Alternative names: Transmutation of the Mind to Flesh,
Blessing of (insert Outer God or Great Old One’s name here),
Rite of Shaping.
