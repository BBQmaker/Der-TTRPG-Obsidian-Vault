Enchant Spear M
• Cost:  20 POW; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 years
Creates a spear that always hits its target (if within range). 
The weapon must be a wooden spear with a point made 
from bird bone, decorated with feathers from at least thirty 
different species of birds, each plucked from a living bird. 
If a feather is lost in use, a new one must be obtained. 
In making the spear, the caster performs a ritual with the 
chosen spear at the Spring Equinox for two consecutive years. 
At the end of the second ritual, the spear must be used to kill 
a living creature, sealing the enchantment. It always hits when 
thrown, but is otherwise an ordinary weapon (an attack roll 
is made, but success is automatic unless a fumble is rolled, 
in which case the spear is broken and no longer enchanted. 
Living targets are unable to dodge the spear. On impact, the 
spear inflicts 1D10 damage and acts as a magical weapon 
against Mythos entities (unless resistant to impaling weapons).
Deeper magic: some learned sorcerers are said to be able to 
recall the spear (costing 5 magic points) once it has struck 
a target (taking at least one round to do so).
