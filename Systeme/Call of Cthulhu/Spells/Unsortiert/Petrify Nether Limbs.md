 Cast
ing time: 1 round
A living subject’s legs are turned to stone. The caster 
must win an opposed POW roll with the spell’s target: if successful, the target is immobilized; their legs no longer 
flesh and blood. The remainder of the target’s body remains 
and functions as normal, provoking a Sanity roll (1/1D8 
loss). The spell’s effect wears off after 1D10 hours.
Deeper magic: if the caster invests an additional 5 POW, 
the spell’s effect is permanent.
Alternative names: Cease Perambulation, Harden Flesh, 
Indurate.
