Worms 6
• Cost:  10 magic points; 6  Sanity points
• Casting time: 2 rounds
Causes thousands of black, wriggling roundworms, each
about six inches long, to generate within the target’s
digestive system, and pour out of their orifices, incidentally
causing death by suffocation. The spellcaster must touch
the target and overcome its POW in an opposed roll.
The generation of additional worms lasts as long as the
target lives—use the Drowning rules (Call of Cthulhu
Rulebook , page 205) to determine length of their fleeting
remainder of life. Dismaying to watch and impossible to
stop, witnesses should make a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss).
While rumors abound within the journals of sorcerers,
no definitive prevention or cure has been uncovered for
this horrific spell.
Alternative names: Congregation of Worms, The Wriggling
Doom of One Thousand Serpents, The Black Writhing.
