Divines the location of an object. For each 3 magic points 
expended there is a 10% chance of locating a lost object. The 
object must be known to the caster. The range of the spell 
may not exceed 300 feet. The spell operates for ten minutes.
Deeper magic: a variant spell, sometimes known as “Finding 
the Cord,” indicates the location of someone or something 
known personally to the caster (or to someone participating 
in the ritual). While the spell cost remains the same, 20 
minutes are required to braid a cord of fibers interwoven 
with bird down. The cord is then looped on the ground and 
a small object, such as an arrow, is placed within the circle. 
The caster pays the spell’s cost, and if successful, the arrow 
immediately flies into the air and unerringly travels toward 
the desired person or thing. If he/she/it is within a mile of 
the caster, it finds what was desired. If further away, the flying 
object may be launched several times without cost, but it 
loses effect after 1D6 hours. Anyone witnessing the object s

sflying may be subject to a Sanity roll (0/1D3 loss, at the 
Keeper’s discretion). The small object flies at MOV 12, and 
so may be difficult to follow, especially if buildings or natural 
obstructions intervene. The flying object and cord both lose 
their magical quality once the item or person is found.
Note that Keepers are advised to make the success roll 
in secret as a fumbled result means the arrow or object 
actually seeks out something other than the person or 
object desired—usually something malign or detrimental 
to health of the caster.
Alternative names: Find Heart’s Desire, Divine Positioning, 
Arrow of Unmasking.
