Great Rite of Sacrifice O
• Cost:  1 magic point; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 hours
A ceremony used to ritually slay someone in order 
to provide magic points or POW to the caster, or as a 
sacrificial gift to a deity. The caster performs a complex 
series of rituals centered upon a human sacrifice and then, 
using an enchanted knife, murders the unfortunate victim. 
If the magic points possessed are going to go to the caster, 
they are added to their magic point tally; however, if not 
used within 24 hours, such extra points are forfeit. The 
magic points gained through this ritual may never exceed 
twice the caster’s normal maximum. 
The caster may instead elect to drain POW from the 
victim, up to a maximum of half of the victim’s POW value. 
This POW must be spent within one hour or the extra 
POW points are lost.
Deities gain the same rewards from the sacrifice as 
would the caster—most times, the caster receives a boon 
from the deity for their offering.
Alternative names: Yan Zon Benefaction, The Grand 
Exaltation.
