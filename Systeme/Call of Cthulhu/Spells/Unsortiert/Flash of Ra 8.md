Flash of Ra 8 6
• Cost:  5+ POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Creates a brilliant flash of light, which can blind some 
beings and may destroy entities such as ghosts and wraiths. 
For every 5 points of POW invested the spells causes 
25 points of damage to non-corporeal creatures within 
10 yards. Light radiates out from the caster and blinds 
all sighted beings within 20 yards if they do not close 
their eyes, turn away, or have some form of eye protection. 
Those who are blinded make a CON roll: if failed, the lack 
of sight lasts for one hour; if successful, blindness lasts 
for only 1D6 minutes (or 1D3 rounds with an Extreme 
Success). Rolling 96–100 results in being permanently 
blinded. 
Alternative names: Scintillation, Abjure Vision, Nullify the 
Seeing Eyes.
