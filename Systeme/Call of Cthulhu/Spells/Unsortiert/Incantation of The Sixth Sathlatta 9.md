Incantation of The Sixth Sathlatta 9 C
• Cost:  none
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This incantation can be used in several ways, none of them 
requiring Sanity point or magic point sacrifices, but with potentially dire consequences for the caster. 
If inscribed upon a wafer of flour in its original 
Ptetholite text and used in conjunction with the Hoy-Dhin 
chant found in the Necronomicon, it may be used to Call 
the Black upon one’s enemies (using the same mechanics as the Call The Black spell, page 61). 
Saying the incantation once before sleep allows contact 
with Yibb-Tstil in dreams. 
If thirteen people together say the incantation on any 
“first day” of a calendar year, Yibb-Tstll is duly summoned. 
Each use of the incantation (no matter its purpose) 
requires a POW roll by the caster: if failed, the caster 
comes to the attention of Yibb-Tstll—how this manifests 
is left to the discretion of the Keeper.
Alternative names: none known.
