Elder Sign, The 2
• Cost:  10 POW

 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
The spell creates or activates an Elder Sign. An Elder Sign 
may be formed into a leaden seal, carved in rock, forged in 
steel, and so on. When made active beside an opening or a 
Gate, it makes that path unusable to minions of the Great 
Old Ones and Outer Gods, as well as to those greater 
beings themselves. Without the spell’s power, the symbol itself means nothing and has no effect.
The writings of certain scribes apart, the Elder Sign 
is worthless in personal defense if the Mythos entity can 
evade the Sign. Those wearing an Elder Sign around the  
neck, for instance, might gain protection for a few square 
inches of flesh where the Sign rests against the skin; 
however, the rest of the wearer’s body would be completely 
vulnerable. Elder Signs are sometimes used as means to 
warn the unwary that “danger” lies ahead.
Alternative names: The Elder Seal, The Omen Branch, The 
Five Points of Wisdom.
