ing time: 1 hour
This spell may only successfully be cast in the Dreamlands. 
Causes disease-infested rats and insects to swarm over an 
area, spreading a terrible plague. If bitten or stung, a victim 
automatically contracts the plague, its first symptoms 
appearing in 1D3 days. The victim loses 1D20 CON every 
day thereafter until the victim dies or is cured. All skills 
drop by ten percentiles daily.
An infected dreamer may be cured with a successful 
Medicine roll, regenerating all lost CON points overnight 
(as well as skill points). Although surviving the plague 
makes one immune to further infections of the same 
disease, the spell produces a different disease with every 
use, rendering immunity to this magic unlikely.
The first disease-carrying creatures appear in 2D10 
minutes, followed by additional hordes over the next 2D10

percentiles (a result of 96–100 is always a failure). Each casting 
of this spell also costs 3D4 Sanity points. A flute is needed to 
cast this spell; if the flute is enchanted, it increases the chance for 
the spell’s success by +2 percentiles per point of POW within the 
flute. Cultists are fond of performing this spell at any time that 
is especially unhallowed—typical nights would be Midsummer’s 
Eve, Samhain, and Walpurgis Night.

Recitation of the Maddening Piping.
 
Summon Shoggoth: a single shoggoth emerges from the 
earth or ocean. The caster must work this ritual in darkness, 
in a wilderness area. Fresh blood from one or more sacrifices 
(equivalent to SIZ 100) should be poured into the dirt or 
ocean while the ritual of summing is spoken aloud. The ritual 
is very difficult to enunciate, as it includes series of glottal stops, 
interdental, palatal, and uvular sounds (possibly mimicking elder 
thing speech patterns) and requires a successful Hard Know roll 
the first time this spell is cast to ensure the correct vocalizations 
are made (thereafter, the Keeper may waive this requirement).If the shoggoth is not immediately bound it will show great 
displeasure towards the caster and any others present. 
Deeper magic: certain elder thing and deep one artifacts are 
thought to mimic this spell, allowing the artifact’s controller to 
summon and command a single shoggoth or, possibly, a group of the loathsome horrors.
Alternative names: Call Worker, Bring Beast of Burden.

Summon Star Vampire: requires a book in which are written 
the words of the spell (loose pages or a scroll will also suffice). 
If the book is enchanted, the chance for success is increased by 
+2 percentiles per point of POW within the book. This spell 
can be cast only at night under a cloudless sky. Curious rustling 
sounds are heard once this invisible thing lurks nearby. The 
creature remains invisible save when its veins fill with blood 
from some visible creature.Alternative names: The Night Call of the Feasting Death, Chant 
of the Bloody Letters.

hours. The first day the affected area has a diameter of one 
mile, this area increasing by an additional mile per day until 
the plague bearing creatures die out in 2D6 days, or the 
plague is somehow banished. Summoned plagues are not 
contagious; the disease can only be transmitted by the bite 
of an insect or other animal. If an infected dreamer wakes 
before dying he or she is cured and shows no symptoms of 
the disease on their next visit to the Dreamlands.
This summoned plague may be banished by successfully 
casting this spell in reverse; however, those already infected 
must still be cured with Medicine or face a lingering death. 
Alternative names: The Pestilential Swarm; Scourge of Death.
