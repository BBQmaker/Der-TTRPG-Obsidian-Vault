Lame/Heal Animal (Folk) 0
• Cost:  4 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points 
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Causes one animal, usually a horse or cow, to suffer painful 
inflammation of its tendons and ligaments, or to become 
extraordinarily healthy and vigorous, as the caster chooses. 
The caster must touch the beast for the spell to take effect.
Deeper magic: with a significant cost in magic points, the 
caster could conceivably cause a whole herd to become lame. 
Variations on the casting of the spell may provide clues to 
nature of the animal’s suffering. Sometimes the caster must 
leave a mark on the animal, other times the caster must bury 
a totem of some kind within the vicinity. Such clues may 
lead a wary farmer to conclude that dark witchcraft is afoot. 
Alternative names: Blight Beast, Hex, The Ill Wind.
