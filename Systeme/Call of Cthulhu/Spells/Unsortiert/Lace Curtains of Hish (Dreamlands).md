Lace Curtains of Hish (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Causes strange 
orange and red delicately patterned forms to dance about 
before the caster, who may move them at will up to 10 yards 
per round. The spell costs 3 magic points per round it is 
maintained. If the patterns, 6 feet in diameter, are moved 
to envelop someone, that individual’s visually oriented skills 
(including combat skills, Spot Hidden, etc.) suffer a penalty 
die. In addition, any visually oriented skills targeting the person 
enveloped also suffer a penalty die. The target can, of course, get free of the enveloping patterns by simply moving away. 
Alternative names: The Undulating Cloak, Hish’s Whirling 
Configuration.
