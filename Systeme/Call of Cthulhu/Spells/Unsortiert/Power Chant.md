Power Chant O
• Cost:  5 POW; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 10 minutes
Allows the caster to temporarily double their magic points 
by permanently sacrificing 5 POW. The caster must chant 
for ten minutes while intoning the true names of certain 
deities, after which 5 POW points are forfeited. The caster’s 
increased magic points remain only from sunrise to sunset, 
or sunset to sunrise, depending upon when the spell is cast.
The loss of POW may be invisible to observers or can 
take a more dramatic effect: unnaturally aging the caster, 
causing flesh to wither, hair to turn white, and so on.
Alternative names: Drain Self, K’stolian Chant, Mass 
Enervation.
