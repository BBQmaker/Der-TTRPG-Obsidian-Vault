Enchant Amulet of The Old Ones M
• Cost:  10 POW; 1D4 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 3 days
Requires a small flat stone lozenge attached to a cord. One 
face of the stone is inscribed with the sigils for a specific 
Great Old One. Once the amulet is crafted and the spell’s 
costs invested, the stone feels cold to the touch. If worn 
next to the skin, it provides the wearer with an additional 
5 magic points per day. The amulet also provides +10% 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
towards attempting the Call Deity spell (page 53). The 
amulet also has a habit of adhering to skin, causing 1 hit 
point to pry it free.
A major side effect to using the amulet is that it leeches 
life force from its wearer. Each month spent wearing the 
stone causes a permanent loss of 1D10 CON. If the amulet 
consumes more than half the user’s original CON, they 
find themselves with a terminal disease and, whether or 
not the amulet is removed, they will continue to lose the 
1D10 CON per month until dead. Removing the amulet 
before the disease strikes prevents further decline, but does 
not restore lost CON.
