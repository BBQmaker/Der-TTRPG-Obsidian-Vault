• Cost:  12 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. A greenish-
white spiral of light is created, which slowly spins (MOV 1) 
toward a chosen target, which may be up to 100 yards away. 
The spiral creates a 3-foot-diameter circular hole in the target 
substance. The depth of the hole depends on the density of the substance targeted. The spiral will penetrate two feet of granite, five feet of wood, or six inches of iron. Any human 
who does not leave the path of the spiral as it creeps towards 
them is killed outright as it cuts a hole through their body.
Alternative names: Creeping Slicer, Caustic Will, Corkscrew.
