events may break concentration, determined by a INT 
roll). Clothing and equipment/weapons remain visible, 
so the target must strip naked. While invisible, the target 
remains audible. 
Deeper magic: a variant does away with the need to chant 
to maintain the spell; instead, a salve is prepared from a

runs through the Enchanted Forest, near Ulthar. The plant 
is poisonous to consume and tricky to identify.
Alternative names: Become as Ghost, Mask, Chant of 
Unseeing.
