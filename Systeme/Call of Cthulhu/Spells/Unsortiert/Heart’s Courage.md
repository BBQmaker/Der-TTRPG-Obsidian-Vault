 Cast
ing time: 24 hours
A protective spell against those with knowledge of the 
Cthulhu Mythos. The caster carves runes dedicated to a 
specific Mythos deity into the wall or floor of the area to 
be protected, then prays to the entity. 
Those who come near to the runes and who also possess 
the Cthulhu Mythos skill must intone the entity’s name to 
be allowed to move past. Failing that, the person may attempt 
a Hard POW roll to gain access: if failed, the person finds 
himself or herself paralyzed and frozen in place, although 
their body otherwise functions normally—they can speak and 
see, but cannot move. If left at the warding runes or carried 
past them, paralysis continues indefinitely and the target will 
die in 1D3 days. If carried back, away from the runes, the 
paralysis ends after 2D10 rounds. Those who were frozen 
by the ward may attempt to pass them again at a later time.
From time to time, such a ward may need a new sacrifice 
of POW at the Keeper’s discretion.
Alternative names: The Way is Shut, Chaugnar Faugn’s Ward, 
The Unmoving Curse.
