Eyes of the Zombie 7 n
• Cost:  3 magic points; 1D8+2 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Allows the caster to take direct control of an individual 
zombie (that they have raised and prepared) and thereafter 
to perceive events from the viewpoint of that zombie. The 
eyes of the zombie must first be removed and placed in a 
bath of specific chemicals. The caster also must remove their 
own eyes, allowing the zombie eyes to replace their own. The 
caster thereupon moves, perceives, and reacts as though in the 
body of the target zombie, until such time as the zombie eyes 
are removed from the caster’s sockets. Once activated, contact 
with an individual zombie target can be sustained unbroken 
for 1D3 months (the zombie is then decayed beyond use).
The caster’s eyes (if safely maintained) may be 
re-inserted when desired by repaying the spell’s costs and 
performing a short chant.
Deeper magic: the caster removes only one eye and replaces 
it with a zombie eye, effectively allowing the caster to inhabit 
two bodies at the same time. Should this “double perspective” 
be attempted by a sane individual it provokes a Sanity roll 
(1D4/1D8 loss), plus the additional loss of 1D4 Sanity points 
per day thereafter until the zombie eye is removed.
Alternative names: Dead Sight, Shell of the Corpse, The 
Stalking Witness.
