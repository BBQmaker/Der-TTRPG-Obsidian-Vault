 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Temporarily incapacitates a single target who is within 10 
yards of the caster. For the spell to take effect the caster 
must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. 
Intense, wracking pains seize the target, their face and 
hands blister and drip fluid, and their eyes cloud with 
blood causing temporarily blindness. The target is rendered 
completely helpless during the period of the spell’s effect.
The effect lasts 1D6 rounds, after which sight returns. 
In 3D10 minutes, the target fully recovers and can resume 
normal activity. Traces of physical corruption fade quickly 
and in 24 hours only faint blemishes can be seen on the 
skin. The terrifying experience calls for a Sanity roll 
(1/1D6+1 loss).
Alternative names: Woeful Agony of the Wretched, The 
Festering Blindness of the Seven Hells, Rend Enemy.
