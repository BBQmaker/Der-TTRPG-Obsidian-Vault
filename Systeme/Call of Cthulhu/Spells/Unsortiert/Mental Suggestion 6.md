Mental Suggestion 6 B
• Cost: variable magic points and Sanity points
• Casting time: 3 rounds
The spell allows the caster to command any being with 
human blood in its veins. A single target, visible to the 
unaided eye of the sorcerer, is affected. The target carries 
out all tasks that he or she is commanded to do by the caster, 
even self-destruction. The spell also works against Lengites, 
deep one hybrids, ghoul changelings, and deep ones who 
have interbred with humans, but will not work on nonhuman 
entities, such as shantaks or dimensional shamblers.
The caster intones the spell and relates the suggestion 
to the target. For the spell to take effect the caster must 
succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. Extreme 
suggestions involving death or great harm require a second 
opposed POW roll just before the suggestion is implemented.
The cost for the spell varies with the command. For 
ordinary unthreatening suggestions (drop your weapon, 
hand over your money, leave, etc.), the cost is 5 magic 
points and 1D3 Sanity points. Riskier suggestions, but 
not ones antithetical to the target (go to Dunwich, set 
fire to a building, etc.), cost 10 magic points and 2D3 Sanity points. Dangerous or suicidal suggestions (kill 
a companion, kidnap the President, etc.) cost 15 magic 
points and 3D3 Sanity points.
If used on an investigator, the effects lasts last for 1 
round for each point of INT the caster possesses. If the 
INT of the investigator is higher than that of the caster, 
the caster must win another POW roll every 10 rounds 
(if the investigator wins the contest the spell is broken).
