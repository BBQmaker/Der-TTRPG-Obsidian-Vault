 Cast
ing time: 10 minutes
Allows the caster to project their consciousness into the 
Internet. This spell may only be learned and performed 
if the caster has at least Computer Use 75% and Science 
(Mathematics) 50%. Using virtual reality equipment, the 
caster must spend 10 minutes aligning their mind with the 
interface. Once aligned, the caster’s consciousness is able to 
travel into the electronic domain. Once inside, the caster 
has only INT and POW as functioning characteristics, as 
well as Luck and magic points. Sanity points cannot be lost 
while the caster’s consciousness is inside the Internet (see 
following). Mental skills, such as Accounting, Computer Use, 
and languages remain effective. While inside the Internet, 
the caster loses 1 magic point per hour and cannot regenerate 
magic points while the spell is in operation; although, the 
caster gains the ability to drain magic points from others (see 
following). If the caster’s magic points are reduced to zero 
they become unconscious; since they cannot regenerate magic 
points while in the Internet, they may never wake up again—
unless discovered by someone who is able to provide aid.
The caster can attempt combined Computer Use and 
Library Use rolls to navigate the web to various computer 
terminals, applications, databases, and other locations. 
The caster can read data flows and change data files. With 
a successful POW roll, the caster can deceive or negate 
routine antivirus or standard network defenses (more robust 
defenses may require higher difficulty levels to negate).
The caster may inhabit and look out through a computer 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
screen to see people or locations on the other side of the 
screen; equally, the caster’s ghostly electrical visage may 
be seen by those using the screen (provoking a Sanity roll 
for 1/1D4 loss). The caster may launch attacks against 
someone within a range of the inhabited computer (one-
fifth of the wraith’s POW in feet)—with a successful 
opposed POW roll, the caster can drain 1D6 magic points 
from the unfortunate individual. 
If an inhabited computer terminal loses power or 
is destroyed, the caster’s consciousness is destroyed. 
If somehow cut-off from the Internet, the caster’s 
consciousness becomes trapped in that particular terminal 
until it is reconnected to the Internet (a kindly Keeper 
might allow a Hard POW roll for the caster’s consciousness 
to swiftly exit to safety).
When the caster’s consciousness returns to his or her 
body, they remember everything that transpired. Sanity 
point losses for misdeeds, shocks, or trauma are now 
immediately applied. If the caster’s body dies while their 
consciousness is abroad, their mind remains conscious and 
active until such time as it is extinguished (zero magic 
points or other mishaps). Further dangers of the Internet 
are left to the Keeper’s imagination.
Note: this spell cannot (currently) be found in any tome, 
database, or other repository other than the personal terminal 
of Damon Devlin, an employee of New World International 
and a century-old sorcerer. At the Keeper’s discretion, it is 
conceivable that another powerful sorcerer (who also has the 
requisite mathematics and computer programming skills) 
could replicate or devise a variation of this spell. For further 
information see the scenario anthology Unseen Masters.
