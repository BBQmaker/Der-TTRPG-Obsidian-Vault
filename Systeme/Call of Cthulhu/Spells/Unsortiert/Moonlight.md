The wizard must first craft a small silvery ball, which 
when used with the spell, emits light equal to that of a 
full moon. The light dissipates darkness, shadows, and mist 
for 10 minutes (possibly even darkness or mist caused by 
another spell). The light is said to also reveal the outline 
of invisible creatures to the trained eye (a successful Spot 
Hidden roll is required). The area illuminated is equal to 3 cubic yards per magic point invested.
Alternative names: Moon Glow, Eyes of Lunar, Reveal.
