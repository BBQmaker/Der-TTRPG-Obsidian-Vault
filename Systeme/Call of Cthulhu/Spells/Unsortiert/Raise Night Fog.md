Raise Night Fog b
• Cost: 3 magic points; 1D2 Sanity points
• Casting time: 5 minutes
Calls forth a dense ground fog from a body of water. May 
be cast only at night. The ritual involves a bowl for water, 
filled from the body of water where the fog is to form. The 
caster blows gently across the surface of the container while 
making the proper gesticulations. The fog forms suddenly; 
if there is wind, it drifts naturally with the wind. The fog 
dissipates with the rising sun. The caster may be many 
miles away from the body of water where the fog appears, 
so long as they have the requisite water.
Alternative names: Poseidon’s Breath, The Cloak of Watery 
Vapor, The Dark Mist of Eternal Secrets.
