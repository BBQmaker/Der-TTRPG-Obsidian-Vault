ing time: 20 minutes
Through a series of gestures and a specific chant, the spell 
reveals to the caster any Gate within the caster’s direct 
vision. While this spell locates a Gate it does not empower 
anyone to open, close, create, or pass through it. Neither 
does this limited form of the spell allow the caster to 
determine whether the Gate traverses time or distance.

Journeying, Fine the Way.
