ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. A chaotic 
blast of green and blue energy is sent up to 30 feet toward 
the spell’s target, who must win an opposed POW roll with 
the caster or be struck deaf, blind, mute, and numb. Each 
hour after being struck by the blast, the unfortunate target 
may attempt an Extreme POW roll to remove the curse 
(curing them of all of its effects). Alternative names: Liken to Corpse, Benumb Thy Enemy.
