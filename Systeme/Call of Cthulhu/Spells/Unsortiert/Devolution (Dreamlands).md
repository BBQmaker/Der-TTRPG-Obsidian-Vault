Devolution (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  24 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The caster 
makes an opposed POW roll against the target: if the 
caster is successful, the target descends the evolutionary ladder, and in 1D6 rounds transforms into an animal-like 
thing, sprouting hair everywhere and growing a snout. The 
change complete, the unfortunate victim attacks those 
nearby (companions and others alike), using hands and 
feet for 1D6 rounds, strangling and scratching, apparently 
without reason. Witnessing this metamorphosis calls for 
a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss). The subsequent character and 
intelligence of the target is for the Keeper to determine.
Alternative names: Growth of the Animal, The Wicked Curse 
of the Beast.
