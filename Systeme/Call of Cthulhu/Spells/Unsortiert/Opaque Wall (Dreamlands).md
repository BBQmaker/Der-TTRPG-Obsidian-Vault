Opaque Wall (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Forms 
a rigid wall covered with esoteric lines and figures. The 
immobile wall formed must be square, and is one yard on a 
side for every 6 magic points expended at the casting. The 
wall is one inch thick and has STR 100. If the wall’s STR 
is overcome by brute force (opposed roll) or exceeded by 
damage (20 hit points), it suddenly disappears. Otherwise, 
the wall acts as if it were a stone wall and remains in place 
for 1 hour.

Pass.
