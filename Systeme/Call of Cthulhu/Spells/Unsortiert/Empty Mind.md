 Empty Mind (Folk)
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1+ year
This spell, Tibetan in origin, comprises a series of mental
exercises allowing the user to fortify their mind against
external assault. The user must embark on a daily ritual of
meditation and mental exercises (4 hours per day), taking
at least one year to master the technique.
The caster spends 6 magic points and doubles the value
of his or her POW against mental attacks. This is effective
against only one single attack and costs the caster 1D3
points of Sanity. Even when mentally attacked without
prior warning, an individual who knows this spell may
attempt to resist with a successful INT roll.
Alternative names: Stong Pa Sems, Way of the Hollow Vessel.

ENCHANTMENT SPELLS
A number of enchantment spells exist, each used to
imbue magic into an object or device. Most of these spells
involve a blood sacrifice, the sacrifice of magic and Sanity
points, and at least a day of time. Each enchantment spell
following details its exact cost and casting time.
Crafting an enchantment brings risk—the item may
have unpredictable advantages and disadvantages. While it
might be useful for probing more deeply into the Mythos,
it might also expose its user to monstrous encounters, or
could offer unexpected doors to other dimensions.
The Keeper should consider how an enchanted item
could affect game balance. Since the enchanted object is
unlikely to vanish from play once introduced; it will alter
the abilities (for good or ill) of the investigators. Make
sure you are certain of what it does, what it costs, and its
implications for your game.
Alternative names for enchantment spells: Charm,
Ensorcell, Fetish, Juju, Trinket, Amulet, Talisman, Phylactery,
Idol, Simulacra.
