Enchantment of Ill Luck M
• Cost:  3 magic points; 5 POW; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 8 days
The enchantment works on an object of significance to the 
intended target (a wallet or locket for example), and causes 
bad luck for the owner. The caster intones a three-hour 
nightly ritual, for a total of eight days, over the object. On 
the last night, the supplicant (if there is one, otherwise the 
caster) pays the spell’s costs.
When touched or worn by the intended target, the object 
causes bad luck. The target’s Luck score is halved* and 
their chance of rolling a fumble on any roll is doubled. 
The bad luck lasts until the cursed object is identified 
and destroyed.
*Neither can the target spend or gain luck points if the Optional 
Luck Rule is being used.
Alternative names: Wanga (Voodoo), Bad Penny, Hex.
