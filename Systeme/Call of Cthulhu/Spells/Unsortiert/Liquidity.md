This dread magic causes puss-weeping sores and results 
in one’s organs liquefying.
The caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the 
target: if successful, the target breaks out in ulcerating sores 
during that first round. During the next round the sores stream 
pus, and the target must make a Hard CON roll to avoid 
vomiting due to the foul stench emitted by the abscesses. On 
the third and final round the target’s blood and liquefying 
organs begin to gush out of the sores, causing instant death. 
If the target can kill the caster before the completion of the 
spell’s effects (before the end of the third round) then there 
is a chance they can survive the ordeal (taking 3D8 damage 
from the spell inflicted injuries, and 1D4/1D6 Sanity loss).
Seeing the effect of this spell costs 1/1D6 Sanity points.
Alternative names: The Putrefying Dissolve, The Wailing 
Agony.
