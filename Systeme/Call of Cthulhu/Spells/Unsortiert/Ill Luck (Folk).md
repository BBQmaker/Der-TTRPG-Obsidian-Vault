 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The caster mutters a curse or passes a cursed item to the 
target, causing the target to experience bad luck for 24 
hours. The caster must overcome the target’s POW in an 
opposed roll; if successful, the target suffers bad luck (must 
take a penalty die on all Luck rolls for the next 24 hours). 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Deeper magic: some cunning folk and witch doctors shy 
away from the use of this spell as they believe the bad luck 
can rebound upon the caster (if the caster fails to win the 
POW roll, they are cursed with bad luck for 24 hours).
Alternative names: Hex, Malediction, Jinx, Execration.
