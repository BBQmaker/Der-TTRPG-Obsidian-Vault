Limbo Gate
• Cost:  5 POW; 1  Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
A Limbo Gate does not lead to another land, but instead 
to a parallel dimension, known as “Limbo.” Entering this  
dimension costs 0/1D4 Sanity points. Visible as far as 
the traveler cares to go are glowing geometric diagrams 
suspended at various angles. Using the Gate into or out 
of Limbo costs 3 magic points. The Keeper chooses where 
and when such portals lead to.
Limbo is coterminous with many times and spaces, 
and is inhabited by ghastly things and many spirits of the 
dead who lost their way traveling to the “eternal reward” 
promised by whatever religion they practiced while living. 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Explorers who do not understand the pathways through 
the various dimensions can also become lost.
Limbo Gates have an inherent danger: they work both ways. 
Ghastly Limbo creatures may discover the Gate’s existence 
and step through to our world. A Limbo Gate remains in  
operation until the caster closes it or after 100 days.
Note: also see Gate, page 120.
