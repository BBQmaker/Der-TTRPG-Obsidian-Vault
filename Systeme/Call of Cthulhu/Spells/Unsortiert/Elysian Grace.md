Renders a target immobile; bodily functions, like breathing, 
slow to an almost imperceptible rate. The spell’s target 
remains conscious, though, and is aware if anyone touches 
them or speaks to them; they simply cannot respond. The 
effect lasts for 1D6 hours.

A poultice of various ingredients is brewed by the 
caster and invested with the spell’s cost. Once made, the 
poultice is viable for 12 hours and must be spread over the 
target’s body. A ritual, lasting half an hour, then follows. 
If the target is unwilling, the caster must succeed with an 
opposed POW roll. 
Certain cults use the spell to ensure the compliance of 
their sacrifices, as well as those wanting sacrifices to be 
conscious but incapable of resistance
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, 
Occult, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure 
that directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names: Cataplasm of Silence, The Living Death.
