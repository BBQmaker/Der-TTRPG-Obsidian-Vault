Strike Blind 6
• Cost:  20 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Causes permanent blindness. The target must be visible 
and be within 30 yards of the caster, who gesticulates and 
cries out a secret name of Nyarlathotep. The caster makes 
an opposed POW roll with the target: if successful, the 
target loses 1D10 Sanity points and 1D4+1 hit points as 
their eyes suddenly melt and flow from their sockets; an 
agonizing and painful process for the target. The target is 
now permanently blind. 
Alternative names: Sight of the Burrower, The Unsightly 
Melting, The Black Pharaoh’s Curse.
