Seal Pit (Dismiss Hastur variant) 8
• Cost:  7 magic points
•
 Casting time:  2 rounds per crystal (6 rounds maximum)
The caster must be in possession of one to three crystals (see Crystal Call, page 90), which act as a catalyst for dismissing 
He Who Is Not To Be Named. Each correctly placed crystal 
adds 20% to the chance of successfully dismissing He Who 
Is Not To Be Named. The caster must expend 7 magic points 
to yield the initial 5% chance to dismiss He Who Is Not To 
Be Named (who, having 175 POW requires the sacrifice of 7 
magic points to gain 5% chance of dismissal). Placing three 
crystals correctly yields a 60% chance of success, totaling 65%. 
If the caster wishes to boost this chance to 99% successful 
dismissal, they must expend an additional 7 magic points. 
Therefore, to gain total mastery over the Seal Pit spell, the 
caster must expend a total of 14 magic points and place three 
crystals in a correct alignment. Each crystal so used must be 
consecrated in blood (a drop of the caster’s blood is all that 
is required). 
Alternative names: Revoke Crystal of Summoning.
