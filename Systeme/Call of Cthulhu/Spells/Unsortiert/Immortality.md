Immortality Q
• Cost:  65 POW; 1D6 + 1D20 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 24 hours to prepare the bowl; 6 days to 
realize the spell
Allows the caster to prolong their life indefinitely. In order 
for this spell to work the caster must prepare a large copper 
bowl into which their corpse will be placed and heated 
after their death. Preparation of the bowl costs 25 POW 
and 1D6 Sanity points. 
Once the pot has been prepared the caster enchants their 
body, investing 40 POW and 1D20 Sanity points. At the 
time of the caster’s death an accomplice should be ready 
to take and place the caster’s body into the bowl, allowing 
it to be heated for 1D6 days. The heat renders the caster’s 
corpse down to its essential fats and (at a suitable point) 
six human hearts are then placed into the bowl. Once the 
sixth heart is in the bowl, the caster’s body reforms and 
returns to immortal life. Immortality means that the caster 
ages at an incredibly slowed rate.
Deeper magic: wise sorcerers should take note that this 
spell grants immortality, not invulnerability. The immortal 
caster may still be killed by violence, although there is 
nothing stopping them from preparing this spell to be cast 
again (and again) if desired. Certain lore speaks of unusual 
energy fields which can harm or somehow diminish the 
life-force of an immortal; whether such fields are magical 
or cosmic in nature is uncertain, and the immortal sorcerer 
would be advised to be wary lest their unnatural lifespan 
be cut short or damaged. 
One variation of this spell calls for a fetish (a ring, 
painting, mirror, or some other object) to be created at 
the same time that the caster enchants their body. The 
fetish must be kept safe and it and the caster’s fate are 
then intertwined as damaging the fetish causes harm to 
the caster; if the fetish is destroyed, the caster immediately 
dies. Consequently, most sorcerers keep their fetish close by and well protected.
