DISMISS DEITY 8
• Cost:  variable magic points 
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ minutes
A deity who does not want to leave Earth may be 
dismissed. Every Dismiss spell differs; the caster must 
know the specific Dismiss spell for the particular deity. 
To perform the dismissal the caster firstly invests 1 magic 
point per 25 POW (round down) possessed by the deity—
this grants an initial 5% chance to dismiss the god and 
enables the process to begin. 
For example: Cthugha has 210 POW and so 8 magic points are 
needed to “open the way” to dismiss this terrible monstrosity.
Once the way is prepared, the sacrifice of more magic 
points can force the deity to depart. In this, the second 
stage, each new magic point sacrificed increases the chance 
that the deity leaves by 5 percentiles. Sacrificing 10 more 
magic points adds +50 percentiles to the chance. As with 
the Call Deity version of the spell (page 53), a group of 
people can assist one another to cast Dismiss Deity (each 
Dismiss spell may limit the amount of magic points a 
“helper” can contribute, whereas the main caster may invest 
as many as desired). The spell takes at least 1 minute to 
perform plus 1 extra round per additional participant who 
donates magic points.
For example: 8 magic points opens the way for Cthugha, 
representing a 5% chance for dismissal. Sacrificing 10 more 
magic points increases the chance to 55%. To have a 99% (the 
maximum achievable) chance of dismissing Cthugha, those 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
assembled must sacrifice 8+19 magic points in the two stages, 
a total of 27 magic points.
Roll 1D100 against the total chance for the dismissal. As 
with Call Deity, the caster is the focus of the spell; other 
members of the group can contribute magic points. While 
Call Deity spells always require special conditions and 
rituals, the Dismissal spell may be cast anytime, anywhere 
(but note, there are sometimes exceptions to this rule, at 
the Keeper’s discretion). 
While many Call Deity spells include a dismissal 
component, there are numerous instances where such a 
spell does not contain the necessary dismissal. Incomplete 
spell transcriptions, lack of knowledge, and evil intent on 
the part of the transcriber are all possible reasons why 
the dismissal elements could be missing. In such cases, 
those wishing to dismiss a deity will need to seek for the 
appropriate Dismiss spell.
Alternative Dismiss Deity spell names: when composing 
alternative names for Dismiss Deity spells, consider the 
following words for inspiration:

 Repudiate
  •     Dispel

Try to use evocative and subtle names for the actual 
Mythos deities rather than simply using their common 
names. Many cultures will name such entities in differing 
ways. There’s no reason why a spell name concerning 
Yog-Sothoth couldn’t reference the being as, The Hideous 
Spheres, or The Unquenchable Thirster of Souls, and so 
forth.
Dismiss Spirit 8
• Cost : variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ hour
Causes a spirit to return whence it came, including returning a disembodied spirit to its original physical 
body. Different cultures have differing practices in terms 
of the ritual, components, and location required to perform 
the dismissal. The caster must invest an amount of magic 
points equal to that of the spirit (i.e. one-fifth of the spirit’s POW), and then make an opposed POW roll 
with the target spirit: if the caster is successful, the spirit is dismissed. Up to two willing assistants, who also know the spell, may spend 10 magic points to support the caster, 
adding a bonus die to the opposed POW roll. 
Note: spirits bound in some manner to a non-living object 
(such as a magical item or relic) are not affected by this spell.  
Alternative names: Exorcism, Ostracize the Devil, Repulsion 
of the Ghost.
