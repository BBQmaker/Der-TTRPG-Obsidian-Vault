spell (if not the caster) must be present and consent to the 
spell (costing them 1D6 Sanity points) otherwise it will fail. 
Once complete, the target lives a normal life and benefits 
from a bonus die on rolls made to resist spells cast against 
him or her (i.e. those that require an opposed POW roll 
to take effect). Side effects, such as feelings of dislocation, 
may become apparent (and present as phobias or manias 
should the person suffer bouts of madness and insanity).
If an enemy should gain control of the soul’s container, spells 
may be cast directly at it (negating any bonus die), with the 
effect that each spell delivers its maximum effects/damage. 
Alternative names: Hide Soul, Create Juju Pot, Counter Hex, 
Create Vessel of Comfort.
