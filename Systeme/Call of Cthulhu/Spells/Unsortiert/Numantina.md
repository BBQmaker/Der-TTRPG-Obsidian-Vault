Drives the target of the spell into a bout of madness (see 
Call of Cthulhu Rulebook, page 156). The spell must be 
cast in sight of the victim, or before a reasonable likeness 
of them, and requires a human liver to be burned. The 
caster attempts an opposed POW roll with the target: if 
successful, the target suffers an immediate bout of madness 
lasting 1D10 rounds—the nature of the bout may be 
decided randomly or specified at the Keeper’s discretion.
