 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Enchants a club to perform as a magical weapon. The 
caster must quench the weapon in the blood of a SIZ 
20 or greater creature. Once enchanted, a club inflicts an additional point of damage (e.g. 1D6+1 for a small club, or 
1D8+1 for a large club) and can cause damage to creatures 
vulnerable only to magic weapons. Armor provides normal 
protection against an enchanted club.
