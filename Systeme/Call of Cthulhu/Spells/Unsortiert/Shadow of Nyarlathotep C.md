Shadow of Nyarlathotep C 7
• Cost: 3 magic points; 1D3+1 Sanity points (+5 POW)
• Cast ing time: 1 hour
Note that 5 POW is consumed when first successfully 
learning this spell. To cast the spell, the caster requires a 
pint of fresh and warm human blood and three live animals 
(such as chickens or rabbits). After sacrificing the animals 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
and intoning dread words to Nyarlathotep, a large, shadowy 
form appears, a shadow of one of Nyarlathotep’s thousand 
forms (dependent on the form known to the caster—for 
example, if cast in Africa, the form might be that of the 
Bloody Tongue). The caster then directs the shadow to a 
target, whereupon it will stalk the target, provoking a sense 
of curling dread and strange coldness around the target. 
The shadow may affect the target in many ways. 
The target or other who see the shadow at a distance 
should make a Sanity roll (1D2/1D6 loss), whereas seeing 
the shadow up close calls for a Sanity roll with stronger 
consequences (1D6/1D20 loss) as far for detail of the 
shadow’s form can be discerned (clawed appendages, 
tentacle where a face should be, and so on). 
The shadow follows the commands of the caster for 
one hour before fading away. It can frighten, horrify, and 
unnerve those who see it, but it cannot affect the target 
or viewers physically, nor move things, or make attacks. 
Common physical symptoms of such a scare include 
nightmares, excessive sweating, and incontinence at night.
The shadow is dispelled by strong light, such as 
the nearby presence of large fire or the headlights of 
automobiles, but ordinary electrical lights have no effect. 
Deeper magic: with the greater cost of 10 magic points and 
1D6 Sanity points, the shadow takes on more physicality, 
able to move objects, knock things over, and vocalize, 
although it cannot directly attack the target. Sanity loses for such uncanny events are at the Keeper’s discretion.

Adumbration of Darkness, Shade of the Messenger.
