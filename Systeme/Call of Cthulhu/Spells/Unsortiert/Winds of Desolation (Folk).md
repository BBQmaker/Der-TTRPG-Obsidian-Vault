Winds of Desolation (Folk) 0
• Cost:  4+ magic points; 1D8 sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Causes winds to increase with great intensity. Cast at sea, 
this spell causes waves to break at the caster’s direction. 
Such winds could also cause fires to spread at the caster’s 
direction. Needless to say, people swallowed up by powerful 
waves or caught in a large firestorm take the appropriate 
damage. It is believed that such winds of desolation blow 
from Limbo, often carrying raging spirits with them.
To determine the spell’s cost see the table (below) for 
examples of wind STR and the number of magic points 
required, taking into account the present weather situation. 
For example, if the wind is (naturally) blowing a gale 
(STR 61 to 100) then the caster, wishing to turn it into a 
hurricane, need only spend 32 magic points (64–32=32). 
The change in weather lasts for approximately 20 minutes.
Those caught outside in such conditions and who try 
to move against the wind unaided, must succeed in an 
opposed STR roll against the STR of the wind.
Alternative names: Call Tempest, Breath of Judgment.
