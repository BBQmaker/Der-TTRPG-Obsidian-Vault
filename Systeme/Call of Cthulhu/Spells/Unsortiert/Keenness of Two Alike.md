•
 Description: tall, majestic, dressed 
in an expensive dark suit, carrying a 
silver-topped cane.
•
 Ideology: the living can tell you little 
you don’t already know, but the dead 
have such stories to tell.
•
 Traits: cold, ruthless, thirsty for 
knowledge. 
Born in Kingsport, Davenport spent more 
time with books than he did with people. 
He dreamt of times long ago when the 
world was a more enchanting place. It 
was little surprise that he chose to study 
history and found his first job at the 
Kingsport Historical Society Museum. 
Not long after starting at the museum, 
Davenport decided to write a book on the 
history of the region. Part of his research 
included the witch trials that had claimed 
the lives of four reputed witches in 1692. 
He cast his net wider to examine similar 
activity in the region and stumbled across 
accounts of Joseph Curwen of Providence, 
Rhode Island. Curwen fascinated Davenport. The scraps of information he found implied that Curwen had resurrected the dead to question them 
about the past. Davenport’s imagination 
was ignited. What if it were possible? Oh, 
the things he could learn: secrets lost to 
the passage of time, confined only by the 
grave—they would be worth their weight 
in gold to the academic community. 
Lawrence searched libraries and 
private collections along the East Coast, 
seeking for details of the dark rites hinted 
at in Curwen’s story. In one such tome, 
Nameless Cults, he found what he was 
looking for. He had no interest in the 
revelations of the wider Mythos that the tome offered, only the knowledge that 
would allow him to raise the dead. He 
set about stealing a fresh corpse from the local graveyard and successfully 
performed the rite; thus, he started down 
the path towards insanity. 
Ten years on, Davenport has acquired 
a terrifying range of spells allowing him 
to manipulate the dead, but this has 
taken an irreparable toll on his mind. He 
has published a handful of moderately 
successful books detailing histories of American Indian tribes along the 
East Coast (although omitting exactly 
how he came by such knowledge). He 
stepped past the point of no return when 
he performed a human sacrifice using a 
homeless man to create a tool to help 
in summoning the dead (his enchanted 
cane). Since then, the ends have justified 
the means. 
He is now no longer in any sane state 
to publish coherent historical works. 
His home, just beyond the outskirts of 
Kingsport, is full of notebooks containing 
scrawled text from his interrogations of 
the dead. He believes that one day these 
notes will form the basis for his magnum 
opus. The isolated house is maintained by 
resurrected corpses: a Cherokee woman 
from the Smokey Mountains, a Union 
soldier from Gettysburg, a militiaman 
from Concord, and a falsely accused 
witch from Salem. Davenport divides his 
time between collating the vast amount 
of historical accounts he has gathered, 
and traveling to out of the way graveyards 
where he can plunder the knowledge of 
the dead.
