An enchanted knife increases the likelihood of success 
when casting certain other spells, as well as performing as 
a magical weapon (able to inflict harm on Mythos entities 
who would otherwise be unaffected by mundane weapons). 
The spell enchants a knife or dagger made of a pure metal, 
such as gold or iron. The caster draws an intricate diagram, 
using the knife’s blade, on a flat surface, and then the blade 
is used to kill an animal of at least SIZ 20. The creature’s 
blood is then traced out to follow the lines of the diagram 
and the enchantment is complete.Such a knife is suitable for use in casting certain 
summoning spells (i.e. Summon Dimensional Shambler, 
page 176). Every point of POW invested grants +1 percentile 
to the chance for success in casting that spell. If this knife 
is used in the performance of Enchant Brazier ( page 107), 
the brazier so made adds +10 percentiles to the chance for 
successfully casting Conjure Glass of Mortlan (page 72).
