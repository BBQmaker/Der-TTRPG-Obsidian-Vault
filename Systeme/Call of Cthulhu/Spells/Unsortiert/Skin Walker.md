Skin Walker 7
• Cost:  1D6+2 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
Causes a specified grave to open and the skin of the body 
within to rise, retain humanoid shape, and to follow some 
simple instruction. The Skin Walker may be commanded 
to attack, whereby it crawls onto the face of a target and 
attempts to smother him or her (use the drowning rules to 
determine if the target suffocates). To pull the smothering 
skin off, the target must successfully oppose the STR of the 
Skin Walker: if the target wins, he or she suffers 1D4 facial 
damage. If a Luck roll is failed, pulling off the malign skin 
tears the target’s skin, causing the loss of 5 APP .
All human skins nominally have STR 60, but Keepers 
may raise and lower this value according to freshness or 
decrepitude of the corpse, whether or not it was embalmed, 
and the wetness or dryness of the grave. All other physical 
characteristics are 60, with POW 5. Sanity loss to view 
the Skin Walker is 1/1D6 Sanity points.
Alternative names: Corpse Flesh, Creeping Flesh, Awaken 
Sheath of the Dead.
