Wasting Curse, The C
• Cost:  15 POW; 2D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 week
Causes rapid aging and eventually death. A week-long 
ritual is required where the caster must solely focus upon 
dark meditations concerning the spell’s target. If during 
this time the caster is disturbed in any way, the spell must 
be restarted and the costs repaid. At the end of seven days 
the caster must win an opposed POW roll with the target: 
if failed, the spell is turned upon the caster (who instead 
suffers the following effects). 
The spell causes a hideous wasting effect, with the 
target aging 10 years for each month that passes. Death 
follows a year and a day thereafter. The target may fight 
off the foul magic if they can succeed in an Extreme 
CON roll (one roll allowable). Whether it is successful or 
not, deduct 1D10 points from each of STR, CON, INT, 
DEX, and APP (adjust hit points and other derived values 
accordingly) per month the spell is in effect. In addition, 
for each month that the spell is active, the target should 
make a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss). Other magical means to 
negate or reverse the spell may exist.
Alternative names: The Doom of Man, Degeneration, Journey 
of Bone.
