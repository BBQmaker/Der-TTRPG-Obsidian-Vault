Feast of the Owl (Folk) 0
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Punishes an enemy by magically transferring a small 
burrowing owl into the target’s stomach, provoking the 
owl to eats its way out. The caster must be able to see the 
target and must win an opposed POW roll with the target. 
If the caster succeeds, then the small owl appears in the 
target’s stomach and begins chewing for 1D4 hit points of 
damage per round. When 8 hit points have been inflicted, 
the be-grimed owl emerges and flies off, never to be seen 
again. The target bleeds 1 hit point per round for 1D6 
additional rounds, or until they receive a successful First 
Aid roll. Throughout the process the target is incapacitated; 
screaming and writhing in horrific anguish. At the end of 
the ordeal they are substantially weakened, losing 1D10 
CON permanently. Witnesses to the emergence of the owl 
lose should make a Sanity roll (0/1D6 loss). 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Deeper magic: the spell may be encountered throughout 
differing cultures and geographies, and the animal is likely 
to different due to this fact. Snakes, frogs, and rats are all 
possible manifestations of this spell.
Alternative names: Implantation of the Burrower, Curse of 
Feathers, Scritch-Stratch.
