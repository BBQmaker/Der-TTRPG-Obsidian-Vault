Fang of Yig O
• Cost:  15 magic points; 5 POW

 Cast
ing time: 6 hours
Launches an appeal to mighty Yig, who may grant some 
form of boon to the caster. To gain Yig’s favor, the caster 
performs the spell, which requires suitable devotions and 
a sacrifice. The caster must either be a serpent person or 
must have found merit in Yig’s eyes through their actions. 
If the petitioner is favorable, Yig accepts them as a “Fang” 
for 1D10 centuries, after which point, a reward of +1D20 
points of POW are gifted to the caster as a sign of regard.
As a Fang, the supplicant is totally at the god’s 
command. Sometimes Yig voices his wishes in dreams, 
which must be obeyed without question, or at other times 
the god commandeers the target’s body and does with it 
as he sees fit and for as long as he desires. The personality 
of the caster is simply along for a terrifying ride. How the 
caster survives for 1D10 centuries to collect the additional 
POW is not a matter of interest to Yig. Note that Yig is 
a jealous being: he never raises Fangs above POW 135. 
Alternative names: Seek the Snake God’s Boon, Ritual of 
the Fang.
