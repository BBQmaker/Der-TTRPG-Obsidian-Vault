Seal of Isis 2
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Protects inanimate objects against magical attack. The 
caster invests as many magic points as desired. If magical 
attacks (spells) are directed into the warded area (a 50-foot 
cube), an opposed POW roll is made by the attacking 
spellcaster versus the number of magic points invested 
multiplied by 5. If the attacker is successful, their spell cuts 
through the ward and may harm the object(s) inside—the 
ward may possibly be destroyed (make a roll against the 
number of magic points invested multiplied by 5: if failed, 
the ward is destroyed).
Note that the Seal of Isis does not defend people, and 
is not a physical barrier against intruders—it only protects 
inanimate objects within the warded area.
Alternative names: Desire of Protection, Seal of Xthenas, 
Seal of Nephren-Ka.
