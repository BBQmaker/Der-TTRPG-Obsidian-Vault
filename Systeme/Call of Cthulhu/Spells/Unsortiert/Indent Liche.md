Compels a reanimated corpse to obey the caster’s commands. 
If the caster wins an opposed POW roll with the zombie, 
he or she may issue one simple vocal command which must 
be obeyed. The spell must be repeated if a complex series of 
actions is required (i.e. multiple commands). The zombie 
will perform a command to the best of its ability; however, 
if the task is not completed within 1D4 rounds the zombie is no longer compelled to finish it.
Alternative names: Command of the Dead, Obligation of 
Death, Corpse Talk.
