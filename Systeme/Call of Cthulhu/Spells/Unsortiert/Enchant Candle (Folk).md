Enchant Candle (Folk) M
• Cost:  4 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day
Requires a day-long ritual and grants a variety of permanent 
effects (increasing a skill by 1D10 percentiles, forcing 
another into undying love with the supplicant, etc.etc.). 
When ready, the candle may be used by the caster or given 
to another. The candle’s user, the supplicant, must sacrifice 5 
POW and 1D4 Sanity points by reciting certain words, and 
may or may not be told what those words cause to happen.
The supplicant’s fingernail clippings or hair scraps 
must be mixed into the wax when the candle is made, as 
must droplets of the supplicant’s blood, and the event the 
supplicant wishes to influence must be written on the side 
of the candle. As the candle burns, the supplicant must 
perform a pertinent activity—the skill to be improved, 
picturing in their mind the person from whom he or she 
seeks undying love, and so forth.
