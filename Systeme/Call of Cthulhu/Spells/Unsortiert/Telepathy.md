Telepathy G
• Cost:  2 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Allows the caster to non-verbally communicate directly 
with another person’s mind. The caster may speak to 
up to three others if all are within visual range (the 
communication is one-way, from caster to receiver). Further 
people can be affected with this spell with the additional 
cost of 1 Sanity point and 1 magic point per three extra 
people. The spell lasts for 2 rounds (which may be extended 
by expending another 2 magic points). 
An unfortunate side effect of this spell means that should 
the caster lose Sanity points while the spell is in effect, 
the same Sanity loss is communicated directly to anyone 
in mental contact with the caster (automatic Sanity loss).
Deeper magic: if the caster knows the desired target 
very well (has had a long, personal relationship) then the 
telepathy is not limited by visual range. In this situation, 
the spell affects only one person at a time. 
Alternative names: Convey Message, Transference of Will, 
Cerebral Conduction, Thought Projection.
