Possess Corpse n
• Cost:  1 magic point; 1D8+2 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Enables the possession and animation of a dead thing for 
a period of up to 10 minutes. Dead things may include 
skeletons, animal corpses (including those that have 
undergone taxidermy or preserved in formaldehyde), animal skins, and human corpses. The caster’s mind is 
transferred to the corpse for the duration of the spell and 
is able to command mobility in the corpse appropriate to 
its condition (dependent on the state of the corpse). 
While the caster possesses the corpse, their own body 
lies motionless and they no longer breathe (their heart 
stops pumping). When the caster returns to their own 
body, they must attempt a CON roll: 
•
 If returning within 1–4 rounds – a bonus die is granted 
at Regular difficulty.
•
 If r
eturning within 5–7 rounds – Regular difficulty.
•
 If r
eturning within 8–9 rounds – Hard difficulty.
•
 If r
eturning in 10+ rounds – Extreme difficulty.If the CON roll is failed, the caster’s body does not 
return to life; the caster’s mind is entombed within their 
own (now dead) body. Another person may perform a 
successful Medicine or a First Aid roll to resuscitate the 
caster’s body—the window of time in which resuscitation 
is possible is left to the discretion of the Keeper. 
Note that if the corpse possessed is one of the living 
dead (a vampire, animated mummy, or a zombie) then an 
opposed POW roll should be made each round for the 
caster to remain in control of the body. If the caster loses 
an opposed roll, their mind is sent back to their own body 
(triggering a CON roll as detailed above). Generally, only 
one corpse can be possessed at any one time.
