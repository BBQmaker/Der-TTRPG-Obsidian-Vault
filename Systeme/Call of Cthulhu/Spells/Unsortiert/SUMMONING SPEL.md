SUMMONING SPELLS
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Casting time: 5 minutes per magic point spent, binding 
takes 1 round.
Such spells concern themselves with alien races and 
attendants, those monsters that commonly serve greater 
powers of the Mythos. The general procedures for these 
spells are the same, but conditions may vary from spell to 
spell. Knowing one such spell is of no use whatsoever in 
attempting to cast another. Often the summon and the 
bind portions of each spell are learned together, but this 
is not always the case. Foolish is the impatient wizard who 
only learns to summon and not to bind.
With a few exceptions (e.g. Summon/Bind Servitor of 
the Outer Gods, and others as noted) these spells require 
the sacrifice of 1 magic point per 10 percentiles chance for 
success. For example, 3 magic points gives a 30% chance 
for the spell to succeed. In general, for each magic point 
spent, the caster must spend five minutes chanting—the

SUMMARY OF 
MONSTER SUMMONING SPELLS 9
This list is not exhaustive.
Summon Baka: may be performed on behalf of a petitioner, 
who must be present with the caster when performing the spell. 
While the caster pays the spell’s costs, a petitioner must also 
sacrifice 1D3 Sanity points. Paraphernalia and ritual for this 
spell will likely conform to the caster’s cultural origins. 
The baka (an “evil spirit”) may grant a single “wish”—if 
the price is right. Negotiations with a baka are usually tricky; 
a successful Persuade roll confirms the payment terms that 
both parties understand and agree to. The baka fulfills the wish 
within 1D6 days and then returns to the supplicant to exact 
payment. The exact nature of the wish is subject to the Keeper’s 
agreement and should be some simple task (scare someone, 
cause ill luck for 24 hours, steal an item, and so on). As for the 
price of the wish, this could be anything within the power of 
the petitioner to offer or do (steal something, harm someone, 
give away possessions, and so on).
Alternative names: Petition Spirit of the Unseen World.

Summon Brother of Chaugnar Faugn: diminutive versions 
of Chaugnar Faugn slumber in vaults below the Earth, to 
awake when the Great Old One once more strides the Earth. 
A bowl of fresh human blood and an open fire are required 
for success. The spell may be cast only on the night of a new 
moon. The blood is dripped gradually into the fire as a chant is uttered. With success, a lesser brother of Chaugnar Faugn is summoned (calling for a Sanity roll for 1/1D4 loss). 
Deeper magic: a variant, which follows the same procedure but 
with an altered chant, summons a greater brother of Chaugnar 
Faugn (Sanity loss 1D3/1D8). Successfully casting the spell 
costs the caster an additional 10 magic points. Quite often 
due to ignorance, mixed-up texts, and general mischievousness, 
the differing variant spells become mixed up—leading to some 
sorcerers getting more than they bargained for.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Greater and Lesser Brothers of Chaugnar Faugn.
Alternative names: Summon Child of Chaugnar Faugn.
Summon Byakhee: a whistle must be blown during the chant. 
This spell is active only on nights when Aldebaran is above 
the horizon (October through March are the best months). 
The byakhee will flap down out of the sky, still icy from space.
If the whistle is enchanted, each point of POW in its 
enchantment adds +2 percentiles to the chance for success. 
Such a whistle may be used again and again.
Alternative names: Call in to Service Thy Steed, The Melody that 
Brings the Journeyed.
 
Summon Dark Y oung of Shub-Niggurath: brings a single 
dark young. A beast of at least SIZ 40 must be sacrificed. The summoner needs a knife to make certain ritual cuts in 
dispatching the beast. The spell should be performed outdoors, 
in a wood, during the dark of the moon.
Alternative names: Evoke the Darke of the Forest, Knife Ritual 
of the Bleeding Bark.

Summon Deep One: a single deep one is summoned. The spell 
must be performed by the sea during the hours of darkness. The 
caster intones a ritual and cuts their flesh (or that of a sacrifice) 
with a knife, allowing the blood to fall into the waters. If a 
deep one talisman is used, the caster gains +10 percentiles to 
the chance for success.
Alternative names: Call Fish Brother, Blood Sacrifice of Hydra, 
Dagon’s Command.
 
Summon Dhole:this exceedingly rare incantation is thought to 
have been originally contained in the Book of Eibon (of which 
only a portion exists today). The spell must be chanted by a large 
group of people who each contribute 1 magic point. The caster 
spends as many magic points as they desire—note that each 
magic point invested (by the caster and supporting chanters) 
only provides one percentile to the chance of success (e.g. if the 
caster invests 10 magic points, and 30 supporters each supply 1 
magic point, the total of 40 magic points equals a 40% chance of 
summoning success). The conditions for the spell are many and

diverse, requiring rare ingredients, at least six hours of chanting, 
and other obscure and bloody components.
If the spell is successful, the number of magic points 
contributed by the group are then multiplied by five to determine 
the SIZ of the dhole summoned. Therefore, the size of the group 
will directly affect the SIZ of the dhole that is summoned. The 
dhole may be bound when it appears and remains controlled until 
the caster frees it (voluntarily, through a loss of concentration, 
falling asleep, etc.), and at that point it disappears. If the binding 
fails, the dhole attempts to eat everyone and then disappears. Of 
course, attempting to summon a dhole to Earth is possibly one 
of the most ill-advised things that anyone could do—even Eibon 
himself warned against such tomfoolery.
Alternative names: Bring Forth the Great Devourer.

Summon Dimensional Shambler: a single dimensional 
shambler gradually assembles itself out of thin air. The spell 
requires a dagger made from any pure metal, such as copper or 
iron (alloys like brass will not work). If the dagger is enchanted, 
the chance for success also rises by +2 percentiles per point of 
POW in the dagger. This spell may be cast day or night. 
Alternative names: Recitation to Bring the Wanderer, The Song of 
Copper, Bring Forth the Thing from Another Place
Summon Fire Vampire: causes one fire vampire to swoop down 
from the sky like a skittering star.
 A bonfire or other source 
of flame is required. The spell may be cast only at night when 
the star Fomalhaut is above the horizon (September through 
November are the best times in moderately northern latitudes).
Alternative names: Conjure the Glittering Ones, The Autumnal 
Call of Living Fire.
 
Summon Greater Desh: the summoned desh bursts from the 
brain of a selected target. The spell may be cast at any human 
target within sight of the caster, or one detected using some 
other spell (such as Sense Life, page 167). The caster makes an 
opposed POW roll with the intended target: if successful, the 
greater desh emerges through a star-shaped opening in the 
target’s head (killing them outright). Those witnessing the event should make a Sanity roll (1D3/1D6 loss).
If the target is able to win the opposed roll and resist the spell, 
the summoning fails; however, the target must make in a Luck 
roll: if failed, a permanent mental link is formed between the 
caster and target that lasts until one or the other is dead. Until 
then, the target experiences, in a dreamlike and fragmentary 
fashion, things the caster experiences and thinks about. 
Deeper magic: a variant summons 2D6 lesser desh, but instead 
uses the brain of the caster as the gateway for entry. The desh 
emerge from small holes in the forehead of the caster as pale 
images, turning solid as they drop to the ground. For every 
three desh summoned (round down) the caster permanently 
loses 5 point of INT.
Alternative names: Summon Thing from Beyond, Convoke Brain 
Eater, Beckon Creature of Nether Realms.

Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Greater and Lesser Desh.
Summon Hunting Horror: a single horror appears headfirst, as 
though entering through a hole in the air. This spell may be cast 
only at night in the open air. If no alternate sacrifice has been 
prepared for the binding ritual it takes the caster and vanishes.
Alternative names: Petition the Feasting Teeth, Utterances That 
Bring Forth the Twisting Devils.

Summon Nightgaunt: a nearly silent swoosh of air comes 
then the single ghastly form of the blank-faced flying horror 
appears. To perform the summoning, a stone emblazoned with 
the cryptic Elder Sign must be present. The spell can be cast 
only at night when there is no moon.
Alternative names: The Whispered Words of the Faceless Men, 
Conjure the Winged Shadow.

Summon Servitor of The Outer Gods: a single servitor arrives 
amid haunting echoes of insane piping. The magic point cost 
is triple that of the standard summoning spell: for each three 
magic points sacrificed, increase the chance for success by 10

greater the chance for success, the longer the spell takes 
to cast. A result of 96–100 is always a failure—a rolled 
result of 100 should always have bad consequences for the 
wizard concerned. 
The caster also loses 1D4 Sanity points per spell cast, 
whether the spell succeeds or not.
If a success, one being appears per spell, 2D10 game 
minutes after the chant concludes. The thing appearing 
usually also requires a Sanity roll to be made in its presence.
As the Keeper wishes, the thing arrives bound or the 
Keeper may ask that the caster make an opposed POW 
roll versus the summoned being (see Binding Spells, page 
41). With a success, the thing is bound; with a failure, it 
attacks the caster and then likely returns whence it came. 
Bound, the thing must obey one order by the caster, even
