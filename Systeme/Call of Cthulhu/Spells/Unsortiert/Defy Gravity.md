 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Allows the caster to reorient gravity around their 
physicality by 90 degrees or 180 degrees for 4D6 rounds. 
The caster could treat a wall as the floor, or could drop to 
the ceiling and walk upon it as if it were the floor (a handy way to hide in a dark room). Treat obstructions, changing 
surface conditions, and so on as if normally encountered. The Keeper always makes the roll for the spell’s duration 
in secret. Those falling to the ground when gravity reasserts 
itself may suffer from falling damage as appropriate to the 
height of the fall.
Deeper magic: the caster is able to increase the area of the 
spell’s effect to affect those within 10 feet. It is recorded that 
the wizard known only as “Shudook” believed this spell could 
be super powered, allowing him to be flung from the surface of 
the Earth to the Moon and beyond. Accounts speak of finding 
a grim crimson mess in the spot where Shudook was believed 
to have attempted his supercharged version of the spell.

Elements, Principles of Force.
