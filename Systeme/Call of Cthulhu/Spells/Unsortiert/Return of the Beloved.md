Return of the Beloved 7
• Cost:  variable magic points; 5 POW;  
1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day
Creates a temporary simulacrum of someone who has 
recently died. The spell requires a day-long ritual and the 
expenditure of magic points equal to the number of days 
the caster wishes the simulacrum to exist. The person to be 
copied must be no more than a week dead. The simulacrum 
is identical to the original in every detail but has only 
half of the original’s INT, and speaks only in one-word 
sentences. Old relationships are remembered, as are skills, 
although knowledge-related skills (like Archaeology) are 
halved. Spells known by the original are less likely to be 
cast (using the new INT value, a Hard INT roll is required 
for a spell to be known).
When the spell expires, the simulacrum collapses to 
the ground and sublimates into a vapor. Reanimating and 
returning to consciousness the deceased can be disturbing 
for former friends and family, calling for Sanity rolls 
(1/1D6+1 loss). 
Alternative names: Apparition of the Dead, Reconstitution, 
The Dead Man’s Favor.
