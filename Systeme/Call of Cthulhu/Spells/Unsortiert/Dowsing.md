Dowsing (Folk) 0
• Cost : 1 magic point; 1 Sanity point
• Casting time: 1 round
The caster crafts a fetish (investing 4 magic points), which is used as a location indicator, and also defines the substance to be found with the fetish. The substance may be anything familiar to the caster and of a clear and definable nature: water, silver, gold, and so forth. The fetish may be a peculiarly bent twig, a bauble on a string, a sliver of wood floating on water, or other device (perhaps appropriate to the nature of the substance sought). The effects of the spell penetrate up to 6 feet of intervening material and lasts for 30 minutes, allowing the caster to track down the substance by the way the fetish points or moves.

Option: if using Ley Lines (see page 19), Dowsing may also locate the existence of ley lines and vortices.

Deeper magic: with the right kind of knowledge, the caster may track down things of the Mythos, such as deep one
spore, byakhee blood, or the brood of Eihort. For suchinstances, a successful Cthulhu Mythos roll is required.
Alternative names: Water Witching, Create Diving Rod, Locate Treasures, Find Substance.
