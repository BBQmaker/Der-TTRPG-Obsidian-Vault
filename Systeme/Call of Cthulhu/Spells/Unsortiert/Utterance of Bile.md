ing time: instantaneous
A curse causing the spell’s target to vomit a torrent of 
foul smelling, green-black bile. The caster, who must be 
able to see the target, calls out the name of one of Shub-
Niggurath’s one thousand young. With this, the target is 
permitted a Hard CON roll: if failed, they succumb to the 
spell and begin to extrude bile from their mouth and other 
orifices. The unfortunate target loses all actions (save the 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
ability to Dodge) for 1D4+1 rounds and any wishing to 
attack him or her gain a bonus die to their attacks. The 
bile is so foul that its smell alone may cause others nearby 
(within 10 feet) to vomit—call for CON rolls to determine 
who succumbs. 
Alternative names: The Mother’s Milk, Rancor of Shub-
Niggurath, The Disgusting Oozing.
