Quicken
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•Casting time: instantaneous
Temporarily increases the caster’s movement rate by
2 and increases their DEX by 10 for 4 rounds. The
procedure involves three rapid hand gestures and a mental
visualization.
While repeated use of the spell is possible, continuous
use has its drawbacks. If the spell is cast successively two
times in a row the caster must make a CON roll: if failed,
the caster immediately falls unconscious and permanently
loses 5 CON points. Should the spell be successively cast
a further two times, a second CON roll at Hard difficulty
is required: if failed, the caster falls unconscious and
permanently loses 10 CON points. Further successive use
increases such characteristic losses.
