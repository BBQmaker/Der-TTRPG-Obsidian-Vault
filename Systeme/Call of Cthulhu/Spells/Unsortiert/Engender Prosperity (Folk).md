 Cast
ing time: 3 hours
A ritual designed to bring wealth to the caster. The spell 
may only be cast on the first Saturday of Spring and requires 
an intricate magic circle, as well as ritual implements (a 
dagger, wand, chalice, and candle). During the performance 
of the spell, the caster invests as many magic points as 
desired (minimum of one) and then attempts a Hard POW 
roll: if successful, the caster will receive “riches” over the 
next month, of a total value equal to the number of magic 
points spent multiplied by $100 (“riches” could mean cash 
money, an inheritance, or some other form of wealth). The 
money never tends to come all at once, and seems to appear 
as the result of happy coincidences or accidents: miscounted 
change, unexpected windfalls, unlooked-for repayment of 
debts, gifts, or even bills found on the ground. Usually, some 
form of sting is attached (a loved one dies, leaving their 
inheritance, and so on) which may cause consternation, 
grief, or guilt on the part of the caster.
Alternative names: Midas’ Song, Inflation of Coin, Reap 
an’ Sorrow.
