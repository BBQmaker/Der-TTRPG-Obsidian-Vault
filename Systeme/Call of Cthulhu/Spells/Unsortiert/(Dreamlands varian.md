This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. This 
variation of the Brew Space-Mead spell initially appears 
to be the same as the Waking World version but it is used 
for an entirely different purpose in the Dreamlands. If this 
space-mead is allowed to soak into the hull of an ordinary 
wooden boat it enables the vessel to sail the winds of outer 
space (once it has fallen off the edge of the world). The 
treatment must be renewed every few voyages. A great 
quantity of space-mead is needed for this purpose—the 
number of doses is dependent on the vessel’s size, at the 
Keeper’s discretion.
Note: space-mead is not essential for space travel in the 
Dreamlands. The mysterious black galleys, as well as the ivory 
ships of Sarrub, can sail thusly without such aids.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, or 
Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure that brewing 
directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names: Craft Star Liniment, Unguent of Airy 
Travel.
