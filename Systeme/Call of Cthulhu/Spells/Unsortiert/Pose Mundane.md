Pose Mundane n
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Causes a creature or object to become totally unremarkable 
in the minds of viewers. The caster must sacrifice magic 
points equal to one-fifth of the SIZ of the creature or 
object, plus one magic point per round to maintain the 
effect. An inanimate object can be masked indefinitely by 
the sacrifice 5 POW during the casting.
Those coming into the vicinity of the masked object or 
creature are beguiled and fail to notice it – to them the 
thing is essentially invisible. If, somehow, frequent contact 
with the item is made (such as standing next to it) a person 
may perceive (POW roll) that something “around them”  
is unusual or odd.
Deeper magic: a human subject of this spell is liable to go 
insane if they endure prolonged “invisibility” to those around 
them. For each day spent under the spell, the target should 
make a Sanity roll (0/1D4 loss)—once this roll is failed, for 
each day thereafter, the target automatically loses 1 Sanity 
point until either the spell ends or they go permanently insane.
Alternative names:  Mask, Dark Veil of Eibon, Hide in Plain 
Sight.
