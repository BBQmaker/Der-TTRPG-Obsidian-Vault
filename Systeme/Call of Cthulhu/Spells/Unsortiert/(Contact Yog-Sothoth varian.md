(Contact Yog-Sothoth variant)
• Cost: 12 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
• Casting time: instantaneous
This spell must be cast at night under a gateway or 
archway. The caster reaches out and contacts “Charon,”  
the underworld keeper of the way across the River Styx 
(an avatar of Yog-Sothoth). The spell invites Yog-Sothoth 
to possess the caster, perhaps to relay information, magic, 
or to imbue some otherworldly power. Such direct 
contact with Yog-Sothoth always requires a Sanity roll 
(1D10/1D100 loss), which may also be applicable to any 
witnessing the spell.
Alternative names: none known.
