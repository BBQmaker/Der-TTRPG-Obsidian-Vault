Incinerate 6
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
This spell is only effective against living beings and a single 
target must be chosen. The caster makes an opposed POW roll 
against the target: if the target wins, the spell has no effect; if 
the caster wins, the target suffers the spell’s full effects. Successfully cast, the spell inflicts 1D6 points of damage 
per round as the target’s metabolism accelerates, generating 
incredible heat. In the first round the effect is an increased 
temperature and flushed complexion. By the second round 
the target is sweating profusely and blisters begin forming 
on the skin. By the third and fourth rounds internal fluids 
reach boiling point and the target writhes in agony while 
coughing up steaming bile, blood, and bits of their own 
boiled organs. The process continues, past death, eventually 
reducing the corpse to ashes and bone fragments. Witnessing 
such a demise calls for a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss). 
Alternative names: Flaming Envelopment, Combustion, 
The Fiery Death.
