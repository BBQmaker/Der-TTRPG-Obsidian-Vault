 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Enables the caster to transform into a semblance of one 
of the hideous avatars of Nyarlathotep. By invoking the 
secret names of the Crawling Chaos while drawing blood 
from five cuts on their body, the caster completes the spell. 
Immediately, their skin blackens, limbs twist, and their 
body swells up to four times its original size. The head slips 
open, flowing into a slack maw full of needle-sharp teeth. 
The transformation is unstable, lasting for 1D10+1 rounds 
and then the caster’s body reverts to its natural form.
The caster’s combat capabilities, movement, and other 
applicable skills while transformed are akin to the avatar of 
Nyarlathotep they are embodying. The Keeper should refer 
to the original avatar’s characteristics, which in the main 
can be used “as is” or reduced as deemed appropriate by 
the Keeper. Note that the spells and spell-like abilities of 
the original avatar do not become possessed by the caster, 
and certain characteristics, like hit points, remain at the 
level of the caster’s original body.
Deeper magic: variants of this spell concern themselves 
solely with a particular avatar.
Indiscriminate casting of this spell is liable to draw 
the attention of Nyarlathotep—an entity unlikely to take 
kindly to those imitating its many forms. The Crawling 
Chaos has many curses and unwholesome bargains to 
choose from, should someone misuse its many names. 
Note:  a range of Nyarlathotep’s avatars are described and 
detailed in Malleus Monstrorum.
