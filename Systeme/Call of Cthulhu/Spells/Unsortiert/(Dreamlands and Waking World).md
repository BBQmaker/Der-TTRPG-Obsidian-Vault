(Dreamlands and Waking World) O
• Cost:  1 magic point; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 10 minutes
Locates a dreamer. May be cast in both the Waking World and 
the Dreamlands. The caster must have either met the target 
in person on Earth or while exploring the Dreamlands. The 
caster places a needle upon a bowl of water and concentrates 
while sketching a likeness of the target, which is then burned 
and the smoke inhaled. As the image burns, the needle turns to 
point towards the target. The intensity of the flames provides 
an idea of the proximity of the target. Successive castings and 
accurate triangulations enable the target to be pinpointed. 
Alternative names: Expose the Traveler, Finding Needle.
