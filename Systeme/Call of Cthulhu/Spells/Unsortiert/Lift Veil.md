## Lift Veil
• Cost:  15 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
• Casting time: 3 rounds
The caster calls upon [[Systeme/Call of Cthulhu/Daoloth|Daoloth]] to temporarily lift the veil of human consciousness, allowing the realities of time, space, and dimensions to be revealed. The spell may be targeted at an individual other than the caster; the caster must win an opposed POW roll with the target.
Seeing beyond the veil can be very dangerous. Those unprepared for the experience may suffer massive shocks and quickly descend into insanity, their minds unable to cope with what cascades upon them. Victims of the spell must make a Sanity roll (1/1D10 loss each round for 1D3+1 rounds while the spell is in effect).
Peering beyond the veil of human perception may also draw unwanted attention from Mythos beings, such as the [[hounds of Tindalos]]. Such consequences are left to
individual Keepers to determine as part of their ongoing story or campaign narrative.

Deeper magic: see [[Rend Veil]].
