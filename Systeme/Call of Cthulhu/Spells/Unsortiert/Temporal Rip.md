Temporal Rip
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: instantaneous
Rips the target outside of space-time. To others, the target  appears frozen, surrounded by a jagged darkness through which can be observed the void of space and the dead light of ancient stars long extinguished. The target must be within
the sight of the caster, who uses somatic hand gestures while speaking the names of dead alien gods. The caster can maintain the spell at no additional cost, provided the caster can maintain concentration and the somatic hand gesturing
(the breaking of which cancels the spell). While others may see the target frozen in star-lit darkness, they cannot touch or in any way interact with him or her (the target’s image could be considered an after-image burned on the fabric of reality—when the spell ends, the target actually physically returns).
When released, the target returns to normal space-time feeling sick and weakened for 1D4 rounds (all skill and characteristic rolls are performed with a penalty die), in addition movement is halved. The target cannot recollect the period they were outside of space-time and they have no knowledge of any time having passed.


Playing with the fabric of the universe should not be attempted lightly. Both the caster and the unfortunate target of this spell may inadvertently come to the attention of the
[[hounds of Tindalos]]: each time the spell is cast there is a 1% chance that a hound becomes aware of both the caster and the target. Each time the spell is cast by the same sorcerer the chance of contact with a hound grows by one percentile.
