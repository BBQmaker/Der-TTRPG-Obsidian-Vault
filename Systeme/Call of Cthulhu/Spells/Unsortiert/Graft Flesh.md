Allows the caster to graft a piece of Enchanted Flesh  
(page 108) to his or her body, and have the flesh and its 
armoring effects last forever. The caster must remove from 
his or her own body a corresponding area of skin (SIZ 5

can be grafted. Once cast, the properties of the Enchanted 
Flesh become available to the user forever.
Deeper magic: this is a very rare spell and a jealously 
guarded secret of a handful of wizards.
