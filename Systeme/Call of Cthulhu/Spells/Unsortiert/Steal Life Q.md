Steal Life Q C
• Cost:  15 magic points; 1D20 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1+ round
This devilishly cruel spell drains life from a victim to make 
the caster younger. The spell must be cast under a full 
moon and the target must be within sight and hearing of 
the caster. For the spell to take effect the caster must win 
an opposed POW roll with the target: if successful, the 
target begins to age and decay, with their innate life and 
vitality being consumed by the caster. 
On each round after the spell is cast, the target loses 
1D10 points each of STR, CON, DEX, POW, and APP . 
For each characteristic point drained from the target, the 
caster becomes a day younger. For example, if the spell 
leeches a total of 40 points from the target’s characteristics, 
the caster would become 40 days younger. Meanwhile, the 
target withers; flesh turns grey and begins to flakes away 
until, at the full conclusion of the spell, the target has 
become a horrid dry husk (calling for Sanity rolls from 
witnesses for 1/1D6 loss). The caster may choose to end 
the spell at any point before the target dies—the victim’s 
apparent condition obviously worse the longer the spell 
continues (pale skin, paper-like skin, withered and gnarled 
limbs, and so on). If the caster is slain before the target 
dies, the spell is revoked and the target’s lost characteristic 
points immediately return to him or her.
Deeper magic: this spell may be cast at times other than 
on a full moon. In such an event, the caster does not gain 
the benefits of restored youth, but the victim still suffers 
and dies if the caster so chooses. If the spell is cast under 
a Hunter’s Moon (the full moon following the  autumnal 
equinox), the caster is able to leech the full maximum of 
10 characteristic points per round (rather than roll 1D10) 
from STR, CON, DEX, POW, and APP .
A variant of this spell allows the caster to turn the 
characteristic points drained directly into POW points 
(1 POW point per 5 characteristic points drained).

Blasphemous Sacrament of the Five Cuts.
