Enjoin Pnakotic Pentagram 2
• Cost:  10 POW; 1D4 Sanity points
• Casting time: 3 hours
Consisting of a complex hyper-geometric operation, this is a
powerful warding spell often used in conjunction with the Liao
Drug (see Brew Liao Drug, page 47). The caster must draw

THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
the complicated symbols on a floor and recite an incantation.
Once the sign is properly enchanted, those standing inside the
grand geometry are slightly out of sync with space-time, and
consequently the minds inside the warding cannot be scented
by the [[hounds of Tindalos]]—effectively making them invisible
to the creatures. Similarly, the temporal mind transfer of the
Great Race will not function inside the pentagram as those
within are rendered immune to an unwanted transfer (likewise,
a Great Race consciousness will be unable to leave a possessed
body). Finally, the symbol also serves as a ward against the
risen dead (zombies, incorporeal ghosts, and anything raised
from their essential salts), which cannot cross the symbol.
Deeper magic: in ancient times, the Pnakotic Pentagram
was sometimes found carved across the thresholds of
wizards’ tombs.

Alternative names: Liao Ward, Cloak of Tindalos, Mind Imperceivable.
