Paws of the Bear (Folk) 0
• Cost: 5 POW; 1D4 Sanity points; variable magic points 
per activation
•
 Cast
ing time: 10 days
Enchants a pair of bear paws which, when commanded, 
animate and fight for the caster. The caster must personally 
hunt and kill a bear and remove its two front paws. Over 
ten days the bear paws are prepared through a series of 
rituals. Once ready, the paws are attached to one another 
by a leather thong and may then be carried or worn around 
the caster’s neck.
As desired, the paws are thrown towards an opponent, 
whereupon they animate and attack. The paws require no 
concentration once they are in combat with an opponent. 
Activation costs 10 magic points, providing the paws with 
Fighting 40% (each additional 5 magic points invested 
raises the skill by +10%), in addition 1 magic point must be 
expended for every round they attack beyond the first. The 
paws each inflict 1D10 damage. The paws can only attack 
(and fight back) they cannot dodge; they have 3-point 
armor and 7 hit points each (if reduced to zero hit points 
the paws become useless). Although the paws are magical, 
the damage they do is purely mundane. 
Those witnessing an attack by the paws may need 
to make a Sanity roll (0/1D2 loss). Once the paws are 
activated, the caster may move up to a mile distant without 
affecting the actions of the paws, which will magically 
reappear around his or her neck, dripping blood or not 
depending upon their success.
Deeper magic: the spell as described is one known 
to American Indians, although regional and cultural 
variations are possible. In some cases, the enchanted animal 
parts could be triggered to come to life when a certain 
event occurs (a cave is entered, a door opened, and so 
on), allowing the caster to prepare a nasty trap. Rumor persists that there is way to gain control of such animated 
weapons, allowing a rival wizard to command the weapons 
to attack their owner.

Perceive Text O 
• Cost : 1 magic point; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Allows the caster to read books, glyphs, or other texts 
in pitch darkness, or if blind. When cast, the words or 
symbols are magically comprehended in the caster’s mind. 
The caster must touch the text to perceive it, and also 
must know the language of the text (the spell imparts no 
language comprehension ability). The spell costs 1 magic 
point per six hours, or fraction thereof, of reading. 
Deeper magic: what seems to be a fairly innocuous spell 
belies some potentially horrific consequences. If the caster 
goes insane while using this spell to read a Mythos tome, 
the effects can be disastrous—the caster’s suddenly insane 
mind becomes awash in Mythos knowledge that may (at 
the Keeper’s discretion) cause the immediate release of 
spells contained within the tome: monsters could be 
summoned (but not bound), spells requiring a target could 
randomly latch on to anyone nearby, magical gates could 
open, and so on! The now insane caster, unable to control 
the magical onslaught, may end up dead due to the sudden 
cumulative cost of the spells released.
