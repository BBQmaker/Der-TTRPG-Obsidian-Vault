Drain Youth 6
• Cost:  8 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Allows the wizard to permanently drain 3D20 points of 
CON, STR, or APP (caster’s choice) from the spell’s target. 
The caster must win an opposed POW roll with the target 
for the spell to take effect. The effect manifests as if the target 
was suffering from advanced aging, relevant to the amount of 
points lost and the characteristic involved. A loss of CON or 
STR might mean increased frailty, while a loss of APP would 
take a more cosmetic toll, manifesting as severe wrinkles, 
loss of hair, and so on. The change is permanent unless the 
target can find some way to reverse or alleviate the effects. 
Certain wizards claim that the spell can be recited backwards, 
effectively replenishing the drained points—whether there 
is any truth to such statements is unknown.
Deeper magic: a foul variant (costing 12 magic points) 
allows the caster to possess the drained characteristic for a period of 24 hours. Thus, if the target has been drained 
of 10 points of STR, the caster’s STR is increased by 10 
points for 24 hours.
Alternative names: Withering, Hasten the Passage of Days, 
The Wasting.
