Death Spell
• Cost:  24 magic points; 3D10 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1D3 rounds
Reserved for only the most foul of sorcerers, this spell causes
a bewildered victim to burst into flame. The target must be
within ten yards of the caster. For the spell to take effect the
caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target
during each round of concentration. After 1D3 rounds of
concentration, the target’s skin forms large blisters and he or
she loses 1D3 hit points. In the next round, the target loses an
additional 1D6 hit points; on the third and following rounds,
he or she bursts into flames, losing 1D10 hit points. The stench of burning hair and flesh is overwhelming; all witnesses should
make Sanity rolls (1/1D6 loss). It is impossible to render aid,
since the horrified victim burns from the inside out. Killing or
causing a major wound to the caster stops the spell, otherwise
it will continue until the target is dead.
Deeper magic: rather than cause the target to suffer the
effects of this spell in near instantaneous fashion, the caster
may elect to prolong the spell over a course of days to
enhance the suffering. The caster spends 34 magic points
in casting this version of the spell; however, the caster does
not need to be physically near the target—instead the caster
must possess a piece of the target (hair, nail clipping or
skin, etc.), allowing the spell to be cast from any distance.
The spell begins on the following day of casting and lasts
for however many days it takes to kill the target. For the
spell to take effect, an opposed POW roll must be made
between the caster and the target each day. On the first
day the target suffers a 2 hit point wound, then a 4 hit
point wound on the second day. Thereafter, the wound size
increases by 2 hit points each day (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, etc.). 1D3
points of Sanity are lost each day as the target realizes his
or her terrible fate. On the day that hit points are reduced
to zero, the target’s body is consumed in a ball of flame.

Death’s Breath b

 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
Over the course of 3 rounds, a dense shadowy mist exudes
from the caster’s mouth to fill an area of 3 × 3 × 3 cubic
yards per 2 magic points invested; each measure of volume
requiring one game round to secrete. The mist obscures
vision and can douse small lights, such as candles, and only
the strongest light penetrates at all. The senses of touch and
hearing are benumbed, freezing air blunts the sense of smell,
and it unnaturally withstands even the force of wind. Once
the caster has finished breathing out the mist, it remains in
place for 1D10+5 rounds and then evaporates without trace.

the caster by invoking the secret names of the Outer Gods.
The caster intones the awful names and holds out a hand
toward the source of attack. Until dropping the hand, the
caster may deflect successive attacks by expending magic
points equal to the rolled damage for each attack. If an
attack would have missed, no magic points are expended.
Upon dropping of the hand, the spell ends. The spell may
be recast. The caster may deflect any number of attacks
until out of magic points—the caster may choose to
continue the spell by burning hit points; however, this
may be counterproductive! He or she may choose which
attacks to deflect and from which attacks to take damage,
but must choose before knowing what the actual damage
will be. Lacking the points to fully stop a particular attack,
the spell ends and the attack hits or misses as it would in
ordinary circumstances.
