 Cast
ing time: 4 rounds
Enables the possession of living human beings. By jumping 
from one body to the next, the caster can potentially ensure 
a very long lifespan. The high cost, however, means that it 
is used sparingly, with sorcerers preferring to stay in one 
body as long as possible. 
The caster must be able to see their intended target 
with their naked eye. Words of possession are then spoken 
aloud to instigate the possession; the caster must win an 
opposed POW roll with the target to successfully transfer 
their consciousness. The possessor is unable to access any 
of their victim’s memories while inhabiting their body. 
When the possessor leaves a body, the former victim has 
no recollection of the time when they were possessed—just 
a dark void in their memory. 
Alternative names: Transference of Will, Longevity, The 
Dark Path.
