Time Gate e
• Cost:  variable POW
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour per 5 POW spent
Creates a Time Gate to the future or to the past. The spell 
resembles the Gate  spell (page 120) but costs POW for the 
number of years traveled rather than the number of miles 
journeyed. Use the Time Gate Creation and Travel Costs 
Table (page 180) as a guide to determine POW and magic 
point costs (the Keeper should adjust values as needed). 
The spell only yields a time approximate to that desired, 
though once a Time Gate is created the exact interval 
between “now” and “then” remains the same. 
Deeper magic: the sorcerer is, through the use of diabolical 
symbols and chants, able to create multi-pathway Time 
Gates—thus one door may lead to more than one distant 
time or future. Only the caster knows which path leads to 
which time on entering the Gate. Those foolish enough to 
use the Time Gate unassisted by the caster will be unable 
to determine the correct path and could arrive at any of 
the times the Gate is keyed to (roll randomly). The process 
of creation remains the same (see page 180).
Alternative names: Create Time Warp, Temporal Vortex.
