Ward of Anubis 2
• Cost:  10 magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5+ minutes
Wards a room or location and informs the caster if anyone 
intrudes past the ward. The spell requires a number of 
small stones, each inscribed with a mark of Anubis (often 
linked to Yog-Sothoth), and each must be enchanted with 
10 magic points (these can be prepared in advance). The 
stones are then placed around the edges of the area to 
be warded and 10 magic points are sacrificed to activate 
the ward. The ward continues for as long as the stones 
stay where they are; if the stones are somehow destroyed 
or defaced the ward is broken; however, the stones are 
reusable for later recasting of this spell if undamaged and 
retrieved by the caster. 
If any of the stones are disturbed or crossed, the caster is 
mentally warned of the intrusion. At that time the caster 
may expend a further 10 magic points to obtain a brief 
vision of the intruder.

of Anubis, Dead Stones.
