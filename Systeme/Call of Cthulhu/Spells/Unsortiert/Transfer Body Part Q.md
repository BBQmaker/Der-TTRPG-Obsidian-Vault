Transfer Body Part Q n
• Cost:  10+ magic points; 5 POW; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Allows the caster to transfer a body part between two 
bodies. There is no requirement that organs or limbs be 
interchanged. If a subject is unwilling, the caster must 
succeed in an opposed POW roll. The spell includes an 
enchantment to produce a magical thread used to sew 
the transferred body parts. While most limbs require the 
investment of 10 magic points, more complicated transfers 
carry heavier costs (thus, at least 20 magic points for two 
legs, 100 magic points to transfer a brain and head). If 
one of the subjects is a corpse (i.e. the caster wishes to 
transfer the corpse’s hands to a living subject) then the 
cost increases from 5 POW to 10 POW.To return an original body part to its original owner 
(after having transferred it through this spell) requires 
casting the spell Detransference (page 95). 
Deeper magic: the Brotherhood of the Skin, masters of 
this spell, stake out particular victims for prize pieces of 
anatomy, such as an athlete’s legs, a boxer’s fists, a diver’s 
lungs, a pianist’s hands, etc. The many vile variations 
inherent in this spell need not be detailed.
