Enchanted Dust of Anubis M
• Cost:  5+ POW
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Creates a handful of dust damaging to the undead. The 
caster sacrifices a varying number of POW points to 
determine the strength of the dust. When the dust is tossed 
at an undead creature, the monster must make a POW 
roll: the level of difficulty of the roll is determined by the 
amount of POW invested in the dust’s creation. Regular 
difficulty if the caster spent 5 POW in creating the dust, 
a Hard POW roll if 10 POW was spent, or an Extreme 
POW roll if 15 POW was sacrificed. If the monster fails 
the roll, it is destroyed. 
For this spell, an undead monster is defined as anything 
which had life, died, and was physically animated by magical means: mummies, zombies, and (possibly) 
vampires. Ghosts, wraiths, and ghouls are not undead.
