Quell Suspicion O  n
• Cost:  20 magic points; 1D6 Sanity
• Casting time: 1 week
Makes the caster unremarkable. The caster must spend
seven days performing ritual purification, while also
fasting and meditating. Under the light of a full moon,
at midnight, the caster creates a magical circle, and then
casts the spell. The caster must succeed in a Hard POW
roll for the spell to take effect. With success, the spell
magically dampens the caster’s presence to other people
in the world around them for a period of one month.
This dampening is not invisibility, but rather something
subtler: people will ignore the caster, as if they were of
no importance or relevance to others in the vicinity.
Strange habits or activities will be dismissed and quickly
forgotten. Even those with cause (the police, a tax assessor,
the investigators) must each succeed an opposed POW
roll with the caster to be able to focus upon them and
conduct their inquiry without their mind wandering off
to be concerned with other matters.

Alternative names: Still Suspicion, Guise of Ignorance, Walk Unseen.
