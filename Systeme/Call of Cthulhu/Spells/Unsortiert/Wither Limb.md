A terrifying spell designed to torment and cause permanent 
damage to a target. For the spell to take effect the caster 
must be within 10 yards of the target and succeed in an 
opposed POW roll with the target. If successful, the caster 
nominates an arm or leg. The said appendage rapidly and 
painfully withers and shrivels; causing 1D8 hit points of 
damage and a permanent loss of 2D10 CON. The target 
and any witnesses should make a Sanity roll (0/1D3 loss).
