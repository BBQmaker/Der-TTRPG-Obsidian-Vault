Impeccable Throw (Folk) 0
• Cost:  5 magic points; 2 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
By reciting a short verse, the caster or chosen recipient is 
able to throw an object and have it land exactly where he or 
she desires within 50 feet. The spell guides a thrown object 
to a trajectory that will hit the desired target. Casting 
allows for one object to be thrown.

Implant Fear 6 B
• Cost : 12 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Causes a soul-chilling dread, breaking the target’s concentration 
and disrupting his or her actions. The caster must be able to see 
and point a finger at the target while invoking the curse. The 
sudden unnerving costs the target 0/1D6 Sanity points, and 
they feel compelled to retreat to a safe place—anywhere the 
person would normally feel safe and secure.
Alternative names: Finger of Doom, Eibon’s Jinx, The Evil Eye.

THE CURSE OF IMMORTALITY
Immortality is a gift and a curse. Immortality does not mean 
the character does not age; rather, it means the character lives 
eternally—unless killed—and ages slowly. With each passing 
of one hundred years, if the caster has any remaining Sanity, 
the immortal loses 1D10 Sanity points. Keepers are advised 
to adjust the aging mechanics, with deductions occurring once 
every 100 years (see Aging, page 98, Call of Cthulhu Rulebook). 
It is left to the Keeper’s discretion whether and how much 
EDU increases.
The immortal wizard tends to be overly cautious, as having 
won eternal life he or she fears its loss greatly. Common folk 
are often scared by what they cannot understand and a man 
who never ages presents themselves as a target for rumor 
and mistrust—perhaps they are a vampire or some other 
abomination who must be burned at the stake to ensure the 
safety of the community? Thus, wise wizards prepare for their 
future by “dying” only to return as some distant relation or 
son or daughter so as to obfuscate the truth of their existence.

Imprison Mind 8
• Cost : 10 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 6 or more hours
Destroys the ability of an entity to move magically or 
naturally from mind to mind, possess other beings, or leave 
in any other way the body in which it currently resides. 
The spell may be cast by an individual or a group. For 
the spell to take effect an opposed POW roll must be 
made between the caster and target (possessing mind). If 
the target is overcome, it is forever trapped in its current 
body. If used against a Great Old One, Outer God, or 
avatar, the spell traps the being for only 10 hours minus 
a number of minutes equal to the value of the possessor’s 
POW. Y’golonac, for example, would be trapped for 7 
hours and 40 minutes (having a POW of 140).
Alternative names: Imprison Within Husk of the Living, 
Confine Demon of the Mind, Capture Spirit.
