Sever the Affable Bonds

 Cast
ing time: 3 hours
A powerful curse meant to disrupt the life and livelihood 
of the target. This spell may only be cast when Mars and 
Saturn are in favorable alignments. A successful Science 
(Astronomy) or Occult roll can determine the most 
opportune time for casting the spell (as desired by the 
Keeper—perhaps 100 minus the caster’s Luck in days). The 
caster is required to draw a magical circle, and must possess 
an item owned by the target (this item will be consumed 
in the casting), plus at least one assistant. The combined 
participants contribute 50 magic points (in any division), but only the caster sacrifices Sanity points. 
When the ritual is done, the caster makes a Hard POW 
roll: if successful, the target’s friends, lovers, and relatives 
change their demeanor to the target, becoming testy and unforgiving. The target’s old friends will grow angry and fall out with them over the slightest trifle, acquaintances 
will be contrary and argumentative, and their spouse or 
lover will grow estranged. The target’s job or profession 
will be impacted, as bosses and colleagues suddenly find 
them disagreeable to work with. The curse lasts one lunar 
month, or until magically dispelled.
Deeper magic: if double the amount of magic points are 
invested (100) then the spell works without need for the 
caster to succeed in a POW roll. Variants of the spell may 
also affect the target’s Luck (halving their Luck value) 
and cause a penalty die to be applied to skill rolls such as 
Credit Rating, Charm, Persuade, Fast Talk, and APP rolls.
Alternative names: Negative Disconnection, Disseverment, 
Cleave Heart’s Joy.
