 Cast
ing time: 1D10+20 minutes
This spell consists of a series of verbal exchanges between 
the caster and a group of people (usually their disciples). The 
exchanges can take the form of a devotional song, a face-
to-face confrontation, participative chanting, and so on. The 
magician uses sweeping gesticulations, while the spell’s targets 
require uninterrupted concentration. At the climax of the spell 
the magician drains a small amount of magical energy from 
each of the participating disciples (1 magic point per disciple). 
Those casting this spell should have a way to store the 
magic points prepared ahead of time as they may not hold 
onto magic points above their normal personal maximum 
(unless they are stored in some object or device).
Alternative names: Leeching, Succor, Investment of R’llehr.
