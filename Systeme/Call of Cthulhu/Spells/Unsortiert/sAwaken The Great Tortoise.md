sAwaken The Great Tortoise C
• Cost: 5+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1+ hour
This Japanese spell allows the caster to summon chthonians 
who burrow and “dance” underground for a short time and 
then (usually) depart.
It is said that a great abode of chthonians lies far below 
the main islands of Japan (where three major tectonic plates 
meet). Someday, perhaps, Japan will sink because of the actions 
of these creatures. Some, however, believe that earthquakes 
are caused by a great tortoise upon which the islands rest. To 
awaken this tortoise is to cause great upheavals.
The caster invests 5 magic points for each point of 
earthquake power on the Richter Scale (1–9). If the 
earthquake is above 5 on the scale, there is a chance 
(cumulative 5% per point above 5 on the Richter scale 
(i.e. 5% at 5, 10% at 6, 15% at 7, etc.)) that Shudde M’ell 
arrives and surfaces.
