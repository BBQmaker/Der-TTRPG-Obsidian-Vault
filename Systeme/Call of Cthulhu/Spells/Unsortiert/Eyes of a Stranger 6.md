Eyes of a Stranger 6 B
• Cost:  8 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Causes the spell’s target to see something specified by the 
caster. Affects a single target and takes effect at any range, 
although the target must be within sight of the caster. The 
caster must first win an opposed POW roll with the target, 
allowing the caster to determine the vision with which the 
target is to be burdened. 
With success, the target’s view suddenly changes to that 
which the caster has chosen. If entities of the Cthulhu 
Mythos are made to appear, the target should make Sanity 
rolls; however, the losses for such visions are one-tenth 
normal (a friend changing into Y’golonac, for instance, 
would costs 1/1D2 Sanity points). 
The spell lasts for 1D10+2 rounds. Nothing interrupts the 
vision, which is visible even with the eyes closed. The caster 
must personally have witnessed whatever the target is to see.
Alternative names: Grant Vision, Mental Import, To See 
Through Mine Eyes.
