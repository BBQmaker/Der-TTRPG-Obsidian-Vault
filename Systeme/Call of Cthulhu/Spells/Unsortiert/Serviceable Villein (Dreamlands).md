Serviceable Villein (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  18 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The caster 
must be able to gaze into the eyes of the target, who must 
be within 10 feet, and speak the words of command. The 
target loses all will of their own if they lose an opposed 
POW roll with the caster, obeying all the caster’s 
commands to the letter. Orders that would cause harm 
to the target may be resisted, requiring a further opposed 
POW roll for the caster to maintain control. The mastery ceases after 1 hour, although an additional magic point 
may be sacrificed to maintain the effect for another hour 
(which may be repeated each hour thereafter).
Alternative names: Impose Will, The Wizard’s Decree, 
Obligation of Kraznor.
