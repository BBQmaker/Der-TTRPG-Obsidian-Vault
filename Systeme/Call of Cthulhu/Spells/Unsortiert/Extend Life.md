 Cast
ing time: 7 days
Through great cost, this spell grants immortality to the
caster. The sorcerer first builds a great fire and then follows
precise instructions to summon an ancient being, the name
of which is not given—only those who have successfully
cast the spell know the true identity of this being and not
a single one has ever so much as hinted at the truth.
The summons is lengthy and complex, pushing the
sorcerer to their limits. The appearance of the ancient
being provokes a Sanity roll (1D6/1D20 loss), and if
the entity deems the petitioner acceptable (who knows
by what measures) then an agreement is reached. The
pact states that the entity will age instead of the caster,
but if the caster should die, then the being will possess
and replace the caster on Earth—presumably the being
takes possession of the caster’s body at the point of death
(witnesses may be shocked by the miraculous “recovery”).
Deeper magic: just how long the ancient being remains on
Earth is unclear—quite possibly it is immortal. Given the
desires of wizards for longevity, it is conceivable that the entity now possesses numerous physical bodies on Earth,
all active and perhaps isolated from one another, yet all
working in unison towards some horrific grand scheme.
