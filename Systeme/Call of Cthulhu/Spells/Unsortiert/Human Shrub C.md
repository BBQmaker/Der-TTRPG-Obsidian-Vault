Human Shrub C n
• Cost:  10 magic points; 10 POW; 6 Sanity points 
•
 Cast
ing time: 4 rounds
Requires a living human subject, who is transformed into a 
plant/human hybrid. The caster must be within five yards 
and win an opposed POW roll with the target. While 
retaining consciousness, the target literally takes root in 
the ground, their flesh metamorphosing into plant-like 
growths. The unfortunate target should also make a Sanity 
roll (1D4/1D10 loss).
Those knowing the spell may reverse its effects for the 
same costs, otherwise the target remains a human-plant 
thing, unable to move from where they took root, but 
able to perform some limited actions and vocalizations 
(this could include attacking those nearby at the Keeper’s 
discretion).
Alternative names: The Black Seed, The Green Doom, Song 
of Cybele.
