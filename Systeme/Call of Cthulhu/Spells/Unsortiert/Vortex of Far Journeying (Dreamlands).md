Vortex of Far Journeying (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  16 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 6 hours
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. A black 
vortex appears before the caster, from which a dismal 
voice calls forth, asking the caster where they wish to be 
taken. Upon receiving an answer the vortex rushes upon 
the caster, collapsing to nothingness and taking the caster 
with it. The vortex can carry the caster to anywhere in the 
dream universe, taking only a few minutes to do so. 
If the caster does not know where they intend to go, 
the vortex cannot convey them. Thus, “To the dark side of 
Earth’s moon,” would be acceptable, whereas “Wherever 
they’ve taken Jack” is insufficient, and the vortex would 
ask for clarification.
There is a danger to using this spell. Once the vortex 
enfolds the caster an opposed POW roll is made versus 
the caster (the vortex has POW equal to 4D10 × 5): if the 
caster fails to win the roll, he or she is never seen again. 
No living human magician knows what happens to the 
people that are carried off, but it is surmised that they are 
taken to some other dimension altogether. It is not even 
known if each spell summons a different vortex or if there 
is only one vortex of varying strength.

Transportations, The Black Gyre.
