Pact of Quachil Uttaus Q
• Cost:  5D10 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
A dangerous and powerful pact is made with Quachil 
Uttaus, protecting the caster from death. The spell allows 
the caster to petition the Great Old One who, if appeased, 
grants the pact (costing the permanent loss of 15 POW). 
Those who are successful are physically marked with the 
sign of Quachil Uttaus—their spines become deformed and twisted (reduce CON by 15 points). Once the pact is 
complete, the caster neither ages naturally, nor can they 
be killed by any physical force or mundane injury. Certain 
magical attacks and weapons may cause injury and death.
If the spell is cast in the presence of someone who 
already holds a pact with Quachil Uttaus, the Treader of 
the Dust appears and takes that person already known to 
him, leaving behind only a pile of ash. If contacted but 
with no person ready to enter into the pact (such as if the 
words of the spell are spoken in ignorance or by mistake), 
the Great Old One takes whoever read the words—unless 
the summoner is willing to enter into the pact. 
Deeper magic: this rare spell is found only in the Testament 
of Carnamagos. Reciting the “Forbidden Words” from that 
text is a deadly exercise for the unwary, as merely speaking 
them aloud is enough to enact the spell (with the resultant 
cost) and immediately call forth Quachil Uttaus.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about 
Quachil Uttaus.
Alternative names: Covenant of Dust, The Ashen Bond.
