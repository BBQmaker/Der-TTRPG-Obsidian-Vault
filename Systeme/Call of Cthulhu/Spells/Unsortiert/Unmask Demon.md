Through arcane gesticulation and word, this spell destroys 
any magical disguise used by a living target. The spell 
requires the participation of a group of at least three 
people who chant clearly and rhythmically while their 
leader breaks a raw unfertilized egg on which has been 
drawn an image of the target. For the spell to take effect 
the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the 
target: success allows the participants in the spell to see 
the real identity of the target when next viewed. Sanity 
may be lost when the target’s true form is thus revealed.
Alternative names: Serpent Show Thyself, The Chant of 
Seeing, Lift the Veil.
