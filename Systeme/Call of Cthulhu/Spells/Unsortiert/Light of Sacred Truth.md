Light of Sacred Truth 9
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: up to 100 minutes
A variation of the Call/Dismiss Daoloth, which calls down 
an avatar of the Outer God known as “The Sacred Light, 
The Render of Darkness.” The spell can be cast only at 
night under a cloudless or mostly cloudless sky. A small 
representation of Daoloth (it need not be an accurate 
representation) must be near the caster or the spell will fail.
The spell consumes all magic points from the caster, 
and so the caster falls unconscious before the Render of 
Darkness descends. Others chanting with the caster each 
add 1 magic point to the pool; if other participants know 
the spell, they can contribute any number of magic points 
up to their total. The pool total of magic points is the 
percentage chance that the spell succeeds. For each magic 
point cast the group chants for one minute, but never more 
than 100 minutes in total.
A beam of light first shines on the fallen lead caster and 
then begins to expand in a widening arc to a maximum 
radius at the base of ten feet per magic point sacrificed. 
When the radius reaches its maximum limit, the cone of 
light flares, dims, and then rolls up back into the sky and 
disappears. All who are caught by this harsh, clear light 
are granted the “Gift of Truth”—the veil of earthly illusion 
is rent, and the illuminated understand the ghastly depths 
between the stars and galaxies, and comprehend the terrors 
that lurk there. They can see the ultimate dimension. The 
targets of the Gift see monstrous horrific shapes, and touch 
and tastes all become visual. Only the blind are unaffected by 
the Gift. The Render, having imparted its Gift, then departs.
People exposed to the Gift immediately make a Sanity 
roll (1D10/1D100 loss). Every day thereafter, another 1D6 
Sanity points are lost. The only way for participants to 
combat the Sanity drain is to gouge out their eyes, or to 
be touched by an object that represents Daoloth and for 
the sufferer to command the Gift to cease.
While there is no way to reverse the Sanity loss,  
characters who devise ingenious plans to slow or otherwise 
negate the loss deserve attention and consideration by 
the Keeper.

Light of Seker O
• Cost : variable magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This Egyptian ritual magic spell calls upon the power of 
Seker, the Egyptian god of light, and creates a globe of 
light of variable radius. For each magic point invested, the 
nimbus of light increases its radius by 1 foot. Light emits 
into the area beyond the globe; within the globe there are 
no shadows. The globe of light lasts for 1D10+6 rounds, 
then gutters and dies. 
After chanting and invoking the name of Seker for one 
round, the caster can pick any target within 10 feet at 
which to have a globe of light appear. If cast on a sentient 
being, the caster must win an opposed POW roll with the 
target. If the struggle fails, the spell fails.
If being used against the Haunter of the Dark, an avatar 
of Nyarlathotep, each magic point invested inflicts 1D6 
damage. For example: where 10 magic points are invested, 
10D6 damage per round is inflicted upon the Haunter. 
If the artifact known as the Shining Trapezohedron is 
present and targeted by the spell, the damage against the 
Haunter is doubled. In addition, anyone mind-linked to 
the Haunter has the connection severed by bathing in the 
Light of Seker. Exposing a possessed host or the crystal 
to the Light of Seker will not expel the Haunter from a 
possessed host nor harm the Haunter while it inhabits a 
host; however, at the Keeper’s discretion, such exposure 
could halve the Haunter’s POW and/or negate its spell-
casting ability while the host is exposed to it.

the Haunter of the Dark.Alternative names: none known.
