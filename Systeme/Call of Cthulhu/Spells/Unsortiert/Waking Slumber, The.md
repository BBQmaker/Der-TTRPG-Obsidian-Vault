Waking Slumber, The M
• Cost:  5+ magic points; 5+ POW; 2D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2+ hours
Temporarily breaks down the barriers between the Waking 
World and the Dreamlands, causing the two dimensions 
to coexist in the same time and place in a limited area.
The spell requires a set of icons or stones inscribed with 
glyphs relating to Yibb-Tstll, and imbued with sacrificial 
human blood (SIZ 100 equivalent). The caster plus any 
supporters perform a chant to activate the dimensional 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
transference. Each supporter contributes 1 magic point, 
while the caster may invest as many magic points as desired 
(5 minimum). Each 5 magic points invested provides a 
1-percentile chance of success; thus, if 40 magic points were 
spent, the chance of spell success is 8%. If successful, the 
caster must also expend 5 magic points and 5 POW for every 
minute they wish the juxtaposition of dimensions to last. 
The area affected is approximately 200 yards squared. 
Those inside the area will notice a strange purple tint 
to the light (natural or otherwise), which makes the air 
shimmer. Creatures of the Dreamlands can see, hear, and 
interact with the Waking World, and vice versa, which 
presents both possible benefits as well as dangers. Those 
leaving the affected area disappear as if they have stepped 
through a door. Apply Sanity losses accordingly.
