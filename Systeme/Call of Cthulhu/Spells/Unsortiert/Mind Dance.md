ing time: 6 hours
This ritual restores the mind of one who has gone mad. It 
requires the participation of the mad person, a sacrificial victim 
(who is not insane and who has willingly agreed to help), and 
some assistants (one of whom must know the spell).
The assistants prepare a ceremonial place by creating 
a circular area of order and sanity. The area should be at 
least eight feet wide, be completely clear of objects and 
debris, and completely clean. The sacrificial victim, wearing 
white garments and carrying a large knife, then takes their 
place at the center of the circle, lies down, and begins 
chanting the Psalm of Kush. After the sacrifice has taken 
their place no one else should enter the circle. Meanwhile, 
the assistants begin to chant the verses of Al Gh’ethi Ras, 
allowing their volume to slowly build to a roar and their 
excitement to build to fever pitch.
While the assistants chant, the mad person performs 
the Dance of Madness. As the chant around them builds, 
the mad person allows their dance to grow more and 
more wild. At no time should the assistants or the mad 
person violate the peaceful space of the circle of order, nor 
molest the sacrifice victim. When the madness is at its 
pinnacle, the assistants rush the mad person into the Circle 
of Order, and, with the knife, they kill the sacrifice. The 
mad person bathes in the resultant blood; soaking up the 
victim’s personal spiritual power, allowing the madness to 
drain away. Thus, the mad person’s Sanity is restored. For 
maximum effectiveness, or if the insanity of the mad person 
if particularly acute, it is ideal for the mad person to eat 
the brain of the sacrifice. At the successful completion of 
the ritual, the mad person’s Sanity becomes equal to their 
POW and their madness is gone.
The spell costs each active participant (with the exception 
of the mad person) 1D10 Sanity points. Each assistant 
invests a variable number of magic points: the total 
combined must be equal to the POW of the mad person. 
Note that if the ritual is later explained to the spell’s 
recipient; outlining what they have just done (killed the 
sacrifice and eaten their brain) then a Sanity roll is required 
(1/1D10 loss)—otherwise, they are unaware of the events 
that brought them back to sanity.
Alternative names: Rite of Kush, Restoration, Cleansing of 
the Fanatic.
