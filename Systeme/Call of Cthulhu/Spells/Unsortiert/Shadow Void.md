Shadow Void 6
• Cost:  8 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Subjects the target to immersion in shadow. The caster must 
be able to see, visualize, or speak the name of the target. 
The target suffers complete sensory deprivation, while at 
the same time they are accosted by invisible hands that prod 
and slap (inflicting 1D4 damage per round). The experience 
overwhelms the target and renders them incapable of any 
action for 1D6 rounds. The effects of the spell may be resisted 
by the target on any round after the spell takes effect with 
successful Hard POW roll. If the experience is countered in 
the second round, the target makes a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss); 
however, if the spell runs its course the Sanity loss is greater 
(1D2+1/1D6 loss). Double such Sanity loss if the target is 
currently insane (which may provoke a bout of madness).

Wandering Hands, Immerse Thy Enemy in Profound Darkness.
