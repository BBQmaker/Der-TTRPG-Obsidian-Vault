 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
An enchantment allowing speech between the caster and 
one other to be understood without the benefit of a common 
language. The caster must be able to vocalize. Each 5 minutes 
of conversation costs 1 magic point (the caster may continue 
to pay this cost to increase the time of the spell’s effect).
If the caster goes insane while performing this spell, 
they permanently retain the ability to communicate with 
the person they were conversing with, but are no longer 
able to comprehend any other languages (even their Own 
Language). It is at the Keeper’s discretion whether they 
can relearn any language skills lost.
Alternative names: Direct Connection, Tongue of Many 
Utterances.
