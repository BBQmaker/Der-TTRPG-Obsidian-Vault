Lavender Spheres of Ptath (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  8+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Creates an 
exploding globe. For every 8 magic points spent at the time of 
casting a single purplish-pink globe of energy is formed. Each 
globe is about the size of a basketball and all drift (MOV 5). 
The caster may direct the globe towards a chosen target. When a 
globe collides with any object, it explodes, causing 3D6 damage 
in a one-yard radius. If another sphere is within the area of 
affect, it also explodes, possibly starting a chain reaction if more 
globes are drifting about. The spheres home in on their assigned 
target and can follow it for up to an hour; thereafter, they fade 
away harmlessly. Note that an Emerald Dart of Ptath (page 
106) pops a Lavender Sphere of P’that without exploding it.
Alternative names: Airy Balls of Disaster, Incredible 
Mesmerizing Doom.
