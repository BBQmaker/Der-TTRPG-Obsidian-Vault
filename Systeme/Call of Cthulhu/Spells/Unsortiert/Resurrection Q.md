Resurrection Q 7
• Cost:  3 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 or 2 rounds
Reduces a corpse to its essential salts and compounds, 
a bluish-grey powder, or reverses the process to yield 
ultimately the form and soul of the deceased. A complete 
corpse is necessary. Being resurrected in this manner costs 
the target 1D20 Sanity points.
If only part of the ashy powder is available for the spell, 
the sorcerer gets “onlie the liveliest awfullness” from what’s 
then made flesh. But the successfully resurrected need 
not be all in one piece—as long as the coffin is intact and 
sufficient care is taken to scrape together all the fragments 
and dust within, the spell succeeds.
Reciting the spell backward returns the resurrected 
entity to dust and likewise requires the expenditure of 
3 magic points and 1D10 Sanity points. The dust can be 
retained or thrown away. For the spell to take effect the 
caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
resurrected person. If the caster wins, the target returns 
to dust. If the target wins, it may try to prevent the caster 
from reciting the spell again. Reciting the spell backward 
takes two rounds. In The Case of Charles Dexter Ward , 
many of those resurrected were interrogated and tortured 
to reveal secrets of the past.

Recrudance, Rite of Salts.
