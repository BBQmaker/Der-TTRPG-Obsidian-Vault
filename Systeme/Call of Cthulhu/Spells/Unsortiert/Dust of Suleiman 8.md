Dust of Suleiman 8 6
• Cost:  10 magic points (per 3 doses)
•
 Cast
ing time: 24+ hours (1 round to apply 1 dose)
Creates a grey-green powder that harms unnatural beings 
from other planes of existence. The powder requires the dust from an Egyptian mummy at least 2,000 years old and 
each such mummy suffices for three doses of the magic 
dust. The ingredients also include frankincense, sulphur, 
and saltpetre. Creating the compound can take as little as 
24 hours to many days depending on the competency of 
the caster and accessibility to the ingredients.
When used, an incantation is spoken as the dust is being 
sprinkled. Thrown over a being not of this Earth, the entity 
loses 1D20 hit points per dose (ignoring armor). It takes 
one round to apply a dose. A Throw or Cthuhu Mythos 
roll may be required at the discretion of the Keeper.
The powder works only on extraterrestrial and other 
planar beings, thus the powder would harm a dimensional 
shambler, Yog-Sothoth or a mi-go, but is useless against a 
shoggoth, ghoul, or a deep one.
Alternative names: The Egyptian Powder, Protection of the 
Dead.
