Augments the chance for success in casting particular spells. 
The spell enchants a set of panpipes or a flute. The instrument 
must be at least 90% metal. A ritual is performed over the 
musical instrument. For each 5 POW sacrificed, the pipes  
must be steeped in warm blood for two hours. A new animal 
must be slaughtered for each 5 POW invested. For each 
point of POW invested, the finished instrument grants +2 
percentiles to the chance of successfully casting Summon/
Bind Servitor of The Outer Gods (pages 176 and 42), as 
well as other spells requiring the use of pipes or flutes to cast.
