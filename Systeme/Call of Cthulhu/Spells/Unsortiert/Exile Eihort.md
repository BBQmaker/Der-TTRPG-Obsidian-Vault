Exile Eihort 8
• Cost: variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points (per 
participant)
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
Forces the Great Old One Eihort to remain in its English 
labyrinth for a year and a day. The caster and others (who 
must know the spell) may invest as many magic points as 
desired. Additional participants (without knowledge of the 
spell) who are in physical contact with the caster may invest 
1 magic point each. All participants pay the spell’s Sanity 
cost. The number of magic points invested in the spell is 
multiplied by five to produce a percentile value used by the 
caster in an opposed roll versus Eihort’s POW of 150. If 
the caster wins the opposed roll the spell is successful and 
Eihort cannot leave its labyrinth for 366 days.
Alternative names: Eihort’s Bane.
