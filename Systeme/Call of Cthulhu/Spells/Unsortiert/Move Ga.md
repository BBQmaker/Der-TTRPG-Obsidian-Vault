Move Gate
• Cost: var iable POW; 1 hit point
• Casting t
ime: 1 hour
Enables the caster to hijack an existing Gate (page 120) and 
redirect it to another location. The caster must know where 
the original Gate leads to (assumption is not enough) and 
must also be aware of the location where they wish to divert 
the Gate to (they do not necessarily have had to have been 
there). The caster must use their own blood (costing 1 hit 
point) to reconfigure the Gate’s sigils, during which time they 
sacrifice POW to permanently alter the Gate’s destination. 
The new destination must be nearer to the caster than the 
original: this spell cannot extend the distance a Gate travels 
to, it can only create a new destination that is closer. Thus, 
a Gate to a location 1,000 miles away may only be diverted 
to a location less than 1,000 miles away.
The amount of POW is one-half that of the cost that 
would need to be spent if the caster was creating a new 
Gate from scratch (see Table: Gate Creation and Travel 
Costs, page 122). For example, the caster finds a Gate 
to a place 10,000 miles away and wishes to change the 
destination to a place 1,000 miles away. The cost to create 
such a Gate from scratch would be 10 POW; thus, to 
change the Gate will cost the caster 5 POW.

Journeying, Transition Shifting.
