LIMBO
Limbo (literally meaning “border” or “prison”) represents the 
interstices between the spheres that compose the universe. 
Limbo has many names depending on a person’s system of 
belief: (the first circle of ) Hell, Hades, the primordial Chaos 
or Void, Sheol, Nilfheim, and so on. Limbo is an extension 
outside of time and of our material world, and borders many 
times and places.
Ordinary senses are useless in Limbo, and position, duration, 
and motion have no meaning. Limbo creatures are generally 
spirits (bodiless and possessing only INT and POW), who 
are able to perceive the approach of other spirits and beings 
while in Limbo.
