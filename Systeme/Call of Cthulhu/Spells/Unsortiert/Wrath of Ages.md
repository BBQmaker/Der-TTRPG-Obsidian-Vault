Wrath of Ages 6
• Cost:  10 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points; 1 hit point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This deadly spell is only cast in dire need as it exacts a 
heavy cost upon the caster. The caster slices deeply into 
their open hand (1 damage in each instance) and gestures 
toward their intended target(s) in an arc, spraying their 
blood through the air. The caster may select 1 to 5 targets, 
allocating 5D6 in damage split between these targets. Thus, 
1 target could receive 5D6 damage, whereas 5 targets would 
each suffer 1D6 damage. The damage ignores armor and 
manifests as the target withering rapidly. Skin begins to 
decay and turn to dust to the point where a target killed 
by the spell simply explodes in a cloud of dust and ash.
Alternative names: Consign to Dust, The Hateful Pox, Blood 
of Decay.
