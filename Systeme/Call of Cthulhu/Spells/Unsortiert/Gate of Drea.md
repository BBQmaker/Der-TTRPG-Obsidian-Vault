Gate of Dreams
• Cost: variable magic points; variable POW; 1 Sanity 
point
• Casting time: hours equal to the number of magic 
points expended
This spell, which is very similar to the Gate of Oneirology  
(following), creates a permanent gateway to the Dreamlands. 
However, it does not allow someone from the Waking 
World who crosses into the Dreamlands to return, ever. The 
Gate of Dreams moves any being to Earth’s Dreamlands, 
transubstantiating the Dreamlands equivalent for the 
traveler’s earthly body and gear. Alas, the Earthly body dies 
irretrievably after taking the thirteenth step past the Gate; 
no return from the Dreamlands is possible after then.
Those who proceed into the Gate will seem to fade 
slowly away, while a corpse version of the traveler slowly 
begins to coalesce into existence at the entrance to the 
Gate. The traveler will be able to see their own corpse 
forming if they look back. If they should decide to turn 
around before taking their thirteenth step beyond the Gate 
they may return to the Waking World.Opposite: Gate by Goomi

The requirement of familiarity with the desired 
destination of the Gate are the same as for the Gate 
of Oneirology spell, but as this spell is somewhat more 
limited in its usefulness, it requires only half as much POW 
(round any fractions down) be sacrificed. For example, a 
Gate Of Dreams opening onto Ulthar would require 10 
POW be sacrificed, while a Gate of Dreams leading to a 
site in Yuggoth’s Dreamlands would require 22 POW. It 
is possible to distinguish between the two types of Gates 
with a successful Cthulhu Mythos roll.
The only known ways to pass through a Gate of Dreams and 
be able to return is with either the artifact known as the Silver 
Key, or if the key to the Gates of Wonder is in the traveler’s 
possession. The traveler must bear either key with them on 
both their entrance to and exit from the Dreamlands, or else 
they will become a permanent resident just as if they had 
entered without a key to begin with. It is possible for someone 
to enter with one key and leave with the other.
Alternative names: Portal to Dream, Irrevocable Path.
