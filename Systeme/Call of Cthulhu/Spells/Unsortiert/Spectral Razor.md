Spectral Razor 6
• Cost:  variable magic points; 2 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Creates an invisible blade that can be used as an offensive 
weapon. The spell costs 2 magic points per round to 
maintain the effect. The immaterial knife is used with the 
casters Fighting (Brawl) skill as if they were holding a real 
blade (i.e. the caster makes cutting and stabbing motions 
with the hand in which they are “holding” the immaterial 
knife). The magical blade inflicts 1D6 damage in successful 
attacks, can impale (but receives no damage bonus), and 
can damage creatures only affected by magical means. The 
spectral weapon cannot become stuck in the victim. 
Should the caster go insane while wielding the spectral 
razor, the weapon takes on a life of its own, spinning out 
of the caster’s hand and proceeding to fly about the area, 
randomly attacking those nearby. Attempts to dodge 
the blade are made with one penalty die; if the dodge is 
unsuccessful the blade automatically hits the target. The 
weapon will carry on in this fashion for 1D4+1 rounds 
before vanishing.
Deeper magic: a variant allows the caster to use the 
spectral razor as a ranged weapon; its reach being a number 
of yards equal to half of the caster’s POW. The target must 
be visible. If the target is concealed behind obstacles or obstructions, the damage is done to intervening objects 
until the Keeper believes enough damage has been caused 
that the target is visible and vulnerable. 
Alternative names: The Razor’s Tickle, The Cutting Hands, 
Song of Slicing, Rent and Waft.
