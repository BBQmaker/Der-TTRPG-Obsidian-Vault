ing time: 3 rounds
The caster creates a zone of darkness through the playing of 
music from enchanted pipes or a flute. The caster must be 
able to play the instrument, which must already be enchanted.
The darkness is centered on the musician caster and 
moves with him or her. Each magic point expended 
increases the zone of darkness by 1 yard (radius). From the 
third round of playing, all light around the caster is drained 
away, effectively blinding everyone nearby, including the 
caster. The music must be played continuously for the 
darkness to remain.

Curse, Melody of the Black.
