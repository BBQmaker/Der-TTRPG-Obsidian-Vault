Oscillating Expanse
• Cost:  10 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
Creates an area that diminishes the mental faculties 
of those who enter. The sorcerer specifies the area, its boundaries and dimensions, through strange rotations 
of the hands and arms, while intoning a chant. The area 
described, which can be no larger than 20 square feet, 
is invisible until someone enters the space, whereupon 
the space is filled with pulsating lights and sounds. The resultant “noise” reduces the mental abilities and 
willpower of those inside: their POW, INT, EDU, and 
mental/knowledge skills are all halved (become Hard rolls) 
while they remain inside the ensorcelled area, their minds 
transfixed by the bizarre nature of their surroundings. Once 
per round (on the round following their entry) those inside 
may attempt a POW or INT roll to walk or crawl free of the magical space.
Those outside of the area see and hear nothing—the 
people within appear to be simply acting crazily without 
reason. The space remains for 1 hour, but can be extended 
by 1 hour if an additional 10 magic points are invested.
Deeper magic: devious sorcerers prepare such hazardous 
spaces to cause mental enfeeblement, making the rest of 
their magical armory all the more effective against those 
the sorcerer wishes to harm, trap, or enslave. A variant of 
this spell allows the sorcerer to cast a wave of enfeeblement 
at targets within a 5-foot area (the range of the wave 
being 20 feet), with those caught in its arc suffering from 
the same effects as described above (the effect lasts for 
1D4+1 rounds).
Alternative names: Hem and Haw, Box of Weakness, Circle 
of Impoverishment.
