Eye of Light and Darkness 2
• Cost:  variable POW (100 standard)
•
 Cast
ing time: dusk till dawn
A powerful Elder spell that weakens many Mythos agents 
and servants. The spell requires a large sacrifice of POW 
(differing versions vary the amount required). A great sigil 
of the Eye is worked into a hard, natural substance, such 
as granite, and then fixed on a high place in the area to be 
warded. The Eye must be created in the afternoon before 
the full moon rises. At moonrise, the blood of an innocent 
(someone without Cthulhu Mythos knowledge) must be 
used to fill the pupil of the Eye once per hour until the dawn 
(only a few ounces of blood are actually needed).
The participants must chant as the first blood is given, 
repeating aloud a phrase that sounds something like, “SA-
MA, SA-MA, TE-YO, SA-MA” till the dawn. The ward requires POW from the people chanting (not necessarily given with their knowledge). Each hour of the chant, the 
Eye leeches 5 POW from each participant until the exact amount of POW has been absorbed (100 POW for the 
standard version). Those losing all of their POW drop 
dead. If the POW is not accumulated before dawn the 
activation fails, all leeched energy is lost, and the procedure 
must be started again from scratch. The Keeper shouldn’t 
say what is happening until the creation of the ward 
has succeeded or failed; only then should the players be 
instructed to mark off the total losses (secretly recorded by 
the Keeper). If enough POW is gathered within the time 
limit then, when the moon next rises, the pupil of the Eye 
is activated and glows briefly. Thereafter, the symbol cannot 
be removed by physical or regular magical means. When 
nearby, those who created it (and only they) can see a dim 
nimbus emanate from the Eye. 
The Eye of Light and Darkness is powerful. It weakens 
agents, monsters, and minions of the Outer Gods and Great 
Old Ones who enter the area it protects, damaging such 
“servants” at the rate of 1 magic point per hour (which 
they cannot regain until they leave). A servant losing all 
magic points while in the Eye’s area of effect completely 
disintegrates. Contact, Call, and Summon/Bind spells 
may not be cast within the view and reach of the Eye. The 
Eye’s power operates in a 10-mile radius; however, it cannot 
penetrate more than 20 feet of rock or metal. 
To destroy an Eye requires the original spell used to 
fashion it. In most cases, each Eye is unique in terms of 
the chant and rituals required to create it (usually based on 
the locality of the casting). Complex deductions and years 
of painstaking research are needed to reverse-engineer the 
creation spell in order to turn it to the destruction of the 
Eye. Such Elder magic is exceedingly rare and only the 
unwise would dare to tamper with such matters.
