Soul-Trap 8
• Cost:  6 magic points; 5 POW; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day to create talisman
Allows the caster to trap the soul of a target within a 
specially prepared talisman. Creating the talisman costs 
the caster 5 POW. The target must be wearing the talisman 
at the time of their death or the spell fails. If wearing the 
talisman, capture of the soul is automatic. Thereafter, the 
target’s soul can be called forth by the caster with a few 
simple words.
The summoned soul takes the physical form it possessed 
in life, including clothes and accessories, like rings or 
watches. The spirit can be questioned or called upon to 
perform certain tasks, but if it refuses or is hostile, the 
caster needs to win an opposed POW roll to compel his or 
her bidding. Failing this opposed POW roll frees the soul, 
which quickly disappears. Summoned, the soul remains 
apparent for one-fifth of the caster’s POW in rounds, and 
may be summoned again following the same interval.
Alternative names: Bind Ego, Create Soul Stone, Mastery 
of the Dead.
