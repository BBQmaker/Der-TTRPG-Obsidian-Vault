 Cast
ing time: 1 day
A curse that turns an individual into a green pile of mold. A 
day must be spent focusing energy upon the intended target of 
the spell and reciting an incantation to Gla’aki. In the next 24 
hours the caster must personally give a green leaf to the target. 
At dawn on the following day, for the spell to take effect, an opposed POW roll must be made between the caster and 
target: if the caster is successful, the green decay has begun.
Over the next seven days the target effectively turns into 
a green mold. At first, green blotches appear on the skin, 
which later begin to grow mold-like hairs. As the spell 
progresses, more and more of the skin grows green and the 
skin rots. In tandem, the target’s organs also begin to rot 
(causing pain, foul smells, and other unpleasantness). By the 
sixth day the target’s mental facilities rapidly deteriorate, 
and movement becomes impossible. The only known cure is 
to find and kill the caster, which reverses the spell’s effects.
The only written transcriptions of this hideous spell are 
said to found within the Book of Eibon and the Revelations 
of Gla’aki.
Alternative names: none known.
