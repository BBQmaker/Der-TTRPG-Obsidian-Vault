ing time: 10 rounds
A spell from ancient Egyptian sorcery used to part non-
living obstacles (walls, doors, rivers, and so forth). The 
spell costs 2 magic points plus 1 point for each 5 points 
of SIZ (of the obstacle to be parted) above the first 10 
points. Requires sand from a desert, which is enchanted by 
the caster and then spread in a line towards the obstacle 
(in the direction of egress desired). The way that opens is 
wide enough and tall enough for 10 men and 10 horses.
Hard obstacles, such as rock and building walls, are torn 
asunder, causing falling rubble and masonry, and other 
hazards at the Keeper’s discretion.
Alternative names:  Open the Way, Cast Aside Barrier, The 
Grain that Unlocks the Sea.
