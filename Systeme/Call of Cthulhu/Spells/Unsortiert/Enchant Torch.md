ing time: 6 hours
May be used with the Summon Fire Vampire spell (page 
176) to bring more than one fire vampire at a time. The 
caster prepares an iron replica of a torch, of the size and 
heft desired, bearing the Sign of Cthugha. The caster then 
prays to Cthugha for six hours. The torch is then lit and 
the enchantment completed.
Remarkably, the enchanted torch requires no fuel (the 
iron head itself burns inextinguishably and without end). 
Only the instruction in Cthugha’s name to quench itself 
extinguishes the torch. The torch must be lit to aid in 
summoning fire vampires, with each additional fire vampire 
so summoned costing the caster 1D3 sanity points and 3 magic points. 
Deeper magic: one rare variant of this spell is said to be 
able to set fire to gold, lead, iron, and other heavy metals, 
quickly burning them to ashes.
