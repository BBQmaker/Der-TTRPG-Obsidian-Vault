Gate of Oneirology
• Cost:  4 magic points; 20 POW; 1 Sanity point
•
 Casting time: hours equal to the number of magic 
points expended
This spell resembles the Gate  spell (preceding); however, 
it opens a physical pathway to the Dreamlands. When the 
Gate is created, the maker must know the destination in 
the Dreamlands they intend the Gate to lead to. The caster 
must have visited the site and know its relationship to at 
least one other area of the Dreamlands. Travel through 
such a gate is two-way from the Waking World, but things 
originating in the Dreamlands cannot pass through it.
Deeper magic: it is possible to build such a gate to a 
Dreamlands beside Earth’s own. This costs an amount of 
POW equal to the cost for traveling to the spot’s Waking 
World equivalent (see Table: Gate Creation and Travel 
Costs, preceding). For instance, if an investigator, having 
once visited there, wished to build a Gate Of Oneirology 
to Yuggoth’s Dreamlands, it would cost 45 POW, since the 
Earthly Yuggoth (Pluto) is around 5 quadrillion miles away.
Alternative names: The Mortal’s Path to Dream, Conduit 
of Delusion.
