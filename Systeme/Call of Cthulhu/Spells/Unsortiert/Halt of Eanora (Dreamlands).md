Halt of Eanora (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  4+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. A whirl 
of white flakes interspersed with rigid lines of marbled 
substances is sent forth from the caster to the target object. 
The target is permanently turned to stone (though, use of 
the Dreaming skill or other magic could, in theory, return 
it to its former state). This has no effect on stone objects.
The spell costs 4 magic points + 1 point per SIZ point 
of the target. If insufficient magic points are spent to turn 
the entire target object to stone (and the caster elects not 
to burn hit points to feed the spell), then the spell does 
not work. But, if twice as many magic points as needed 
to transform the target are spent, the caster can decide to 
transform only part of the target.
