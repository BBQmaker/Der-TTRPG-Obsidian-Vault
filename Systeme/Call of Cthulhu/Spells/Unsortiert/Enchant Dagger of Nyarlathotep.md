Enchant Dagger of Nyarlathotep M
• Cost:  30 POW; 2D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 week
The caster fashions a flame-shaped dagger (an Art/Craft 
roll may be required). The dagger must then be used to kill 
living beings amounting to 100 POW. The caster pays the 
necessary costs and from then on, when used in sacrifices 
in the presence of Nyarlathotep, the POW of the sacrificial 
victim flows into the dagger. The dagger’s owner may then 
siphon POW from the dagger to be used in spellcasting 
(such POW once used, is drained from the dagger).
