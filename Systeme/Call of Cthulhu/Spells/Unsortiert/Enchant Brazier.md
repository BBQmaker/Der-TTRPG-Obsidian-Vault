Enchant Brazier M
• Cost:  5 POW; 1D4 Sanity points 
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 hours
On the night of a full moon between the autumnal equinox 
and the winter solstice, the caster must sacrifice a small 
animal while intoning a formula and performing certain 
gestures. The chosen brazier is soaked in the animal’s 
blood and sprinkled with a handful of gold dust, silver, or 
mercury. The enchanter must then burn a piece of wood 
at least 500 years old, holding the brazier in its smoke. 
Upon completion, the brazier is enchanted and ready to 
use. The empowered brazier may assist in the performance 
of other spells, such as Call/Dismiss spells, providing a 
bonus die to certain casting rolls or reducing spell costs 
at the Keeper’s discretion.s
