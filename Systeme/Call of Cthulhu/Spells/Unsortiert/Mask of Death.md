ing time: 2 rounds
Enables the caster or another person to assume the face 
of someone else. The caster must have access to the flayed 
facial skin of another person, which must be fresh (i.e. 
the face has been removed within the last 24 hours). As 
the caster places the bloody skin over their own face they 
recite a short prayer to Nyarlathotep. The flayed flesh 
melds with the caster’s face, giving them the appearance 
of the person from which the flesh was removed (APP 
changes accordingly). The new face is permanent but can 
be removed if the spell is recast.
The act of flaying the face off another is liable to 
provoke a Sanity roll.
Alternative names:  Assume Face, Guise of Other, Veneer of 
Flesh.
