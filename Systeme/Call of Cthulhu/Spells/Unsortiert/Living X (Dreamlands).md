 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. A glistening 
pink, crystalline-looking energy shaft is shot up to 30 yards 
towards a living target, who must succeed in an opposed 
POW roll with the caster or be instantly immobilized in 
an upright spread-eagled position. The target may break 
the spell by making an Extreme STR roll, which can be 
attempted once per round, otherwise they must remain in 
this state until released by the caster.
