Rend Veil C
• Cost:  24 magic points; 2D8 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
A deadlier version of the Lift Veil  spell (page 135): instead
of just lifting one veil of human consciousness from the
target for a little while, the caster permanently rips away
the veil causing the spell’s target to disappear. To cast
this spell, the caster must win an opposed POW roll with
the target.
With one of the veils to perception so ripped away, a rift
is created which pulls in the target of the spell. Successfully
cast, a portion of reality twists itself into a fist-sized lump.
It quickly becomes a swirling, churning vortex until the
fabric of reality rips, folding in on the target, who is cast
into the infinite time stream, the swirling multiverse, or
some other portion of time, space, or hyper-reality. They
disappear with the tear in space-time, perhaps lost forever
unless some means of location and retrieval can be found—
if found and returned, they will certainly not be the same
person as they were before!
