Whirligig (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  8+ magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. A gyrating 
whirlwind of black threads sweeps up the target, spinning 
them into the air—unless they win an opposed POW roll 
with the caster. The height may be raised or lowered by 10 
feet per round per extra magic point the caster expends. 
When the spell expires, the target falls and may take 
damage (1D6 per 10 feet); in any case, they are dizzy and 
unable to stand or act for 1D6 rounds or until the target 
successfully makes an Extreme DEX roll, which can be 
attempted once per round. The spell costs 8 magic points 
for each round that the spell is maintained. The spell has a range of 10 feet. 
Alternative names: The Black Spiral, Command Whirlwind, 
Circumvolution.
