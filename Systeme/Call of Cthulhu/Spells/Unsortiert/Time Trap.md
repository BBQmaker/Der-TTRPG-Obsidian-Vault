ing time: 6 hours
A creature or person is transported through time to 
the caster. The ritual involves 6 hours of uninterrupted 
meditation and a large quantity of human blood. To cast 
the spell, the caster must be able to visualize the target in 
its normal setting—for creatures of the past or future, this 
requires that the caster have access to a device that sees 
into the future or the past. The caster makes an opposed 
POW roll with the target: if the caster is successful, the 
snared creature appears anywhere within five miles of the 
caster, always on the surface of the Earth. At that point the 
target is free and functions normally, though it is trapped in 
a new time. A creature requiring alien atmosphere or other 
absent conditions may well die before it can be recovered.
The spell is one-way. The trapped creature cannot use 
the spell to move itself up or down the time-stream. Per 
casting, only one creature is trapped. The spell only works 
through time, not through other dimensions.
