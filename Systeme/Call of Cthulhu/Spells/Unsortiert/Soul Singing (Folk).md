Soul Singing (Folk) 0
• Cost:  8 magic points; 1D4 sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
Causes a single target to see and hear only that which the 
caster desires. The caster must play through a piece of 
music using enchanted pipes (see Create Curse Whistle, page 
86). For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in 
an opposed POW roll with the target.
Soul Singing is aimed at a single target who, seeing what 
the caster wishes, is usually led entranced to some doom or 
destruction. The target is released from the enchantment 
should the caster stop playing the melody. Others present 
cannot hear the tune unless they succeed in a Hard POW 
roll, whereupon a faint, non-directional piping of strange 
melodies is heard.
Alternative names: The Melody of Hamelin, The Piper’s Jig, 
Entrance Soul.
Soul Stealer (Dreamlands) H
• Cost : 24 magic points; 2D6 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. A silvery 
globe (about 6 inches in diameter) whips towards the 
target, passing through them, changes color, and returns 
to the caster (who must be within 30 yards). The globe 
created by this spell takes the victim’s soul from their body. 
All the victim’s INT and all of their POW but 5 points are 
taken into the globe. The target loses 1 Sanity point for 
each day that their soul is kept inside the globe. The globe’s 
color varies with the beliefs and personality of the victim. 
If the globe, which is as fragile as glass (once the victim’s 
soul has been taken), is ever broken the victim’s soul returns 
instantly to its original body. If the body is destroyed, 
the shock releases the spirit from its globe if it can win 
an opposed POW roll (using their normal full POW) 
against the caster. If the spirit is released when the body 
has already been destroyed, it may become a ghost or 
some such wandering spirit and may, in theory, attempt 
to possess a new host body. 
The owner of the globe may communicate with the 
target by holding the globe and concentrating. 
Alternative names: Trap of the Soul, Diminish Enemy, 
Sphere of Denial.
