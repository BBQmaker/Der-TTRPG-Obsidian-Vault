Removal of Favor 8

 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Destroys homunculi created in the image of Tsathoggua 
within the immediate presence of the caster. The caster 
makes an opposed POW roll versus the homunculi’s creator 
(whether alive or dead). Success means that all homunculi 
in the immediate vicinity disintegrate and revert to their original material of construction (e.g. clay). 
More than one person can perform this spell at the same 
time, adding a bonus die to the lead caster’s opposed POW 
roll. Only one bonus die is added, regardless of how many 
others perform the spell at the same time. Opposite: A Homunculi of Tsathoggua by Goomi

Deeper magic: variations of this spell are said to exist 
specifically targeting homunculi servitors of other Mythos 
beings, such as Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, and 
Abhoth. While such variations are rare, the costs for each 
would certainly vary.
Alternative names: Destroy Manifestations of the Toad King, 
Ruin of Clay.
