Creates an ointment allowing the user to soar through the 
air. Requires the rendered fat from an unbaptized male 
child and other ghastly components, which must be brewed 
in a cauldron by the dark of a new moon. The enchanted 
ointment created is destroyed by direct sunlight, so it must 
be stored in a dark place and should be opened or used 
only after sunset. Brewing produces 1D4 applications of 
the flying ointment. The ointment lasts for 1D6 hours, 
allowing the user to fly with MOV 10.
