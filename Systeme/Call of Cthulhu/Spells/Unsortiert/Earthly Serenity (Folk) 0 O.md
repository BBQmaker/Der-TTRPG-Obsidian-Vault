Earthly Serenity (Folk) 0 O 2
• Cost:  3 magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Inhibits the ability to feel pain and brings a calm state 
of mind for a limited time to the recipient of the spell. 
Once cast, the spell causes its target to feel no pain for 
one hour: rolls to remain conscious (caused by reduced 
hit points and/or major wounds) are ignored during this 
period, and the target receives a temporary boost of 2 hit 
points (lost when the spell ceases). In addition, for one 
hour, the target’s mind is serene: phobias or manias can 
be ignored, and Sanity losses are noted but not deducted 
until the spell’s effect ends (any Sanity loss is deducted in 
full at this point, which may provoke a bout of madness, 
and so on).
Alternative names:  Bind Pain, Mantra of Tranquility, 
Manifestation of the Divine.

Effigy of Hate 7
• Cost : 12 magic points; 45 POW; 10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 8 hours per night for 3 nights
Summons an entity that is bound to the caster’s will to 
carry out tasks. The ritual for this spell must be held 
on three consecutive nights, during hours of darkness. 
While the caster invests the necessary magic points in 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
to the spell, the POW requirement is usually “donated”  
by three sacrifices (one per night of the casting)—if no 
sacrifices are available, the POW cost is deducted from the 
caster (15 points per night). In addition, the caster must 
prepare a totem (usually in wood), which can take any form 
(normally a form culturally specific to the caster). Over 
the course of the three nights, the entity is summoned and 
bound into the totem.
On the third night, at the climax of the spell, the Effigy 
of Hate is fully coalesced with the totem. It is bound to 
the caster’s will and may begin to go about fulfilling the 
caster’s wishes. 
The Effigy of Hate is the embodiment of cosmic 
malevolence—a thing of pure darkness and evil. It may 
only leave the totem for short periods. As it is incorporeal, 
it is unable to touch or affect the physical world, but is able 
to observe and gather information as its master chooses. 
While incorporeal, the Effigy is not affected by physical 
attacks (though, magical attacks will cause it damage). 
Once the Effigy has amassed 70 points of POW from 
sacrifices performed by its master (this in addition to the 
45 POW to create and summon it), it gains the ability to 
physically manifest for up to 4 hours at a time (but only 
during the hours of darkness), allowing it to interact and 
be affected by the physical world (i.e. physical attacks now 
can deal damage). The Effigy may absorb a total of 10 
POW per day, so usually seven days and seven sacrifices 
are required for it to become corporeal.
Alternative names: Call Forth Dark Minion, Strike the 
Devil’s Bargain, Manifestation of the Will.
