Trance 6 B
• Cost:  1 magic point; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
The caster sings a tuneless, mirthless melody, oddly 
fascinating to hear. Those who hear this alien music stand 
motionless and unable to act while the caster sings, unless 
they succeed in an opposed POW roll with the caster 
(which means they can no longer be affected by this casting; 
may be attempted once per round). The spell’s duration is 
one round, which may be extended by paying an additional 
magic point per round. May only be cast initially at one 
target, and the caster must be within ten yards of the target, 
who must be able to hear the caster. If the caster extends 
the spell, one additional person may be ensnared by the 
melody in each round after the first, although this also 
increases the cost by 1 magic point per person per round.
Alternative names: Fascinating Melody, Hymnal of 
Stupefaction, Song of the Transfixed.
