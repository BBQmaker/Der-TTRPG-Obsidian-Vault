ing time: 2 days
A doll is soaked in an elixir that includes human blood and 
then a lock of the target’s hair is affixed to the doll (this 
ingredient must be delivered by the supplicant). When 
the doll is stabbed, the target receives a corresponding 
excruciating pain (which could also manifest as vertigo, 
nausea, etc.etc.). If the pin or knife is left in the doll it 
causes continual pain to the target, who must attempt a 
Hard CON roll: if failed, the target receives one penalty 
die to all physical skill rolls for the period in which the 
knife or pin remains in the doll. Removing the knife or 
pin, or burning the doll releases the target.
