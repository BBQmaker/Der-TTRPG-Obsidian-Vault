 Cast
ing time: 6 rounds
The caster performs a debased ritual calling upon various 
Mythos gods for their favor. In return the caster receives 
2D6 magic points. Any magic points stored in excess of 
the caster’s normal pool do not regenerate once spent. 
It is suspected that certain Mythos deities will require a 
formal bond of servitude from the petitioner, or a sacrifice 
or some other gesture, to demonstrate their devotion before 
the entity grants their request for magical power.
Alternative names: Call Power of Nyambe, Favor of (insert 
Mythos deity name).

ing time: 15 minutes
Neatly and efficiently de-bones a cadaver. The spell 
eliminates all bone and cartilage, allowing the dead flesh to 
be stored away. Since the spell can be cast only on entities 
without POW, it achieves nothing against the living or 
against the undead, such as vampires or zombies.
Alternative names: Debone, Make Malleable, Ritual of 
Preparation.
