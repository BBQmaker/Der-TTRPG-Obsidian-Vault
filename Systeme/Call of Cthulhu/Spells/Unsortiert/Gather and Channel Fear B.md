Gather and Channel Fear B O
• Cost:  10+ magic points; 6 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
The caster is able to generate and channel fear, converting 
such energies into magic points; often used effectively in 
conjunction with Send Dreams (page 164)  to give the 
populace in a given area horrid nightmares. 
The caster must shed their blood (1D4 hit points) onto 
an object to be used as a focus for the spell (often a statue 
of a Mythos entity); the more upsetting the caster finds the 
entity, the better. Once the blood has been shed, the caster 
sacrifices 10 magic points per desired mile radius of the 
casting. The essence of the spell is released and everyone 
within the area of effect must make a POW roll (opposed 
by the caster’s POW). For those who succeed there is no 
effect; however, a failed roll means the individual suffers a 
horrifying nightmare (if used with the Send Dreams spell), 
or starts jumping at shadows, grow tense, and acts “on-edge” 
for the next 24 hours. For each person failing the opposed 
POW roll, 1 magic point is leeched and channeled to the 
caster, who may use such points to replenish their own 
supply, or store the energy for future use—however, such 
acquired magic points last only until the next new moon.

Gift of Inanna n
• Cost : 4 magic points; 6 Sanity points

 Cast
ing time: 1 day
Grants beauty to the caster at the expense of another. The 
spell’s target must be within one mile of the caster, who 
spends a day focusing upon the target and performing 
the necessary rituals. At midnight, after the last ritual is 
completed, the caster makes an opposed POW roll with 
the target: if the caster wins, 10 APP is removed from the 
target (making them appear that much older), and 5 APP is 
added to the caster (who now appears that much younger). 
If the target wins the opposed roll, the caster is thrown 
into a coma for 1D3 days and permanently loses 5 CON. 
In most cases, the spell’s target notices no change at all.
Deeper magic: by doubling or tripling the spell’s cost, the caster 
may increase the amount of APP lost and gained (at double the 
cost, the target may lose 20 APP , while the caster gains 10 APP , 
etc.). Note that should the caster fail the opposed POW roll, the 
resultant coma lasts 2D3+1 days, and 20 CON are lost.
