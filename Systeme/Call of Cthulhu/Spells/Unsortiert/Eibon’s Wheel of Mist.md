Eibon’s Wheel of Mist 2
• Cost: 1 magic point (per foot of height); 1 Sanity point
• Cast ing time: 1D3 minutes
Evokes a whirling cylinder within which one or more persons can hide from certain Mythos creatures. A 
small bronze disk etched with a specific arcane symbol 
is required. The caster lays the disk on the floor, stands 
atop it, intones the words of the spell and expends the 
spell’s cost. With success, it generates a 5-foot-diameter 
wheel of spinning blue mist around the caster. Everything 
within the wheeling cylinder of mist is totally obscured. 
The wheel takes 1D3 minutes to form completely, lasts 
for 1D20+10 minutes, and then dissolves.
The mist hides people from creatures summoned by 
Nyarlathotep or in the name of Nyarlathotep. Such a 
creature acts as if the mist and those obscured by it are 
not present. The creature will not move through the wheel’s 
position, even by accident. If the wheel blocks a path, the creature stops where it is or goes backward without 
knowing why. The wheel only affects summoned minions, 
never Nyarlathotep.
As many people as can crowd into the mist can be 
obscured by the wheel; however, if one’s feet, head, etc., 
stick out then the illusion is ruined for all (such aspects 
are at the Keeper’s discretion). To hide a group of normal 
height investigators, 7 magic points are needed.
Creatures present before the wheel of mist is cast or 
called up by power other than that of Nyarlathotep can see 
the wheel and move into it. A person may step out from 
the wheel but this will ruin the illusion if the stepper is 
spotted, as does passing anything through the mist, such 
as a bullet or a sword. Once the creature’s attention is 
caught and it realizes that an illusion is in progress, the 
protection of the spell is lost.

Deception, The Hiding Place.
