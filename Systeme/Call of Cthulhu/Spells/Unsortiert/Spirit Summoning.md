Contacts the dead. The caster must be in physical contact 
with something that was personal to spirit during their life, 
such as the favorite toy of a child, a memento from a special 
vacation, an object of deep sentimental resonance, and so 
on. Possibly, the caster is able to summon a spirit merely 
be sitting in a favored chair or room. In general, the longer 
dead the person, the more intimate the object needs to be. 
Once in possession of such an object, the caster slides 
into a deep trance. The caster should invest as many magic 
points as desired. Multiply the magic points by five for a 
percentage value; the caster must roll under this value to 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
be successful in summoning the correct spirit. If successful, 
the caster will usually look up within a minute or two, 
their expression and attitude a mirror of the deceased 
person. Once the summoned spirit is in the caster’s body, 
it will need a moment or two to adjust to its new home, 
attempting to control muscles and senses, then gradually 
remembering how to speak. 
Others present at the summoning may take part in 
the “séance”. As the caster sits to one side, all others in 
the room must join hands in a circle and each loses one 
magic point (added to those of the caster for the value to 
determine success). If at any time this circle is broken, the 
spirit will be free to depart.
Inhabiting the strange body is uncomfortable for the 
spirit, and it will usually ask to be released before long. 
A hostile spirit may be coerced into answering questions. 
The spirit cannot depart until the séance circle is broken, 
or it overcomes the POW of the highest individual in the 
circle in an opposed roll. 
Deeper magic: calling forth the dead brings risks, and 
despite best intentions, sometimes something other than 
the desired spirit makes an appearance. Such situations 
may result in a different spirit possessing the caster, or 
even something from beyond (which may be a great deal 
more difficult to throw-out, should the entity decide it 
likes its new host body).
Note: if required, apply the rules for Spirit Attacks and 
Possession (page 14) as necessary.
