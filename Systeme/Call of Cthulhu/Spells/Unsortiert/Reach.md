Reach
• Cost: variable magic points; 5 Sanity points 
• Casting time: 1 round per magic point spent
Allows the caster to reach through intervening surfaces 
and volumes, to the physical extent of his or her arms 
or tentacles, and adjust things, implant new elements, 
or withdraw existing ones. Cost of the spell varies: for 
each inch of organic surface (such as wood) to be passed 
through, the caster must spend 1 magic point, or 2 magic 
points if the surface is non-organic (such as rock).
If there is a possibility of the caster’s concentration being 
broken during the spell (from an attack or similar) they 
should attempt an INT roll: if failed, the spell ceases, 
which may cause the caster’s appendage to be trapped, 
requiring the spell to be recast to extricate themselves.
Alternative names: The Wizard’s Hand, Pass Through Stone, 
The Thief ’s Trick.
