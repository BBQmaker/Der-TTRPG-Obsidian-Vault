This spell is a guarded secret of the Brotherhood of the 
Skin and reverses the Transfer Body Part spell (page 181). 
Oppose the caster’s POW with the target’s POW: if the caster 
succeeds, the borrowed organs and fleshy members appear in 
the caster’s hands, sodden and rotting. Bereft of vital organs, 
the target normally dies quickly. The spell costs no Sanity 
points unless it succeeds, in which case, it costs 1D10 Sanity (unless the caster has experience as a doctor or nurse).
Note: see Horror On The Orient Express for details 
concerning the Brotherhood of the Skin.
Alternative names: none known.
