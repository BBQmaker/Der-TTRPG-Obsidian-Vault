Mandrake (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  10 magic points; variable POW;  
1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 week
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Creates 
a small simulacrum semi-bound to the caster. The spell 
requires a living mandrake root and a week of ritual. A 
faceless, semi-living simulacrum is created with a value 
of 1D6 × 5 for each characteristic of STR, CON, SIZ, 
POW, and DEX, but not INT. For every 5 points of POW 
sacrificed, 2D6 × 5 is added to one of the mandrake’s 
characteristics, including INT, chosen by the magician. 
The mandrake is under the magician’s mental control 
(unless they have given it some INT, see following) and 
does whatever the magician wills it to do. The magician 
can only control the mandrake when it is within sight. If 
the mandrake has been imparted INT it also has free will 
and can do as it pleases when not in the magician’s sight—
usually, such mandrakes are quite malign and destructive.

Servant, The Mage’s Helper.
