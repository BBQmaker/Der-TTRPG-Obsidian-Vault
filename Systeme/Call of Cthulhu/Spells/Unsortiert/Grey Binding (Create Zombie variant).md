 Cast
ing time: 1 hour 
A ritual liquid must be poured over a prepared corpse. The 
ingredients of the liquid differ depending on the version 
of the spell; however, the blood of the sorcerer appears 
common to all. Other ingredients should be determined 
by the Keeper—at least one should be costly or illegal, or 
perhaps radioactive. Once the corpse has been prepared 
and the liquid decanted, the caster intones the spell. With 
success, the corpse rouses. Literally mindless, the zombie 
is akin to a wild animal and is not under the control of its 
creator. The zombie continues to rot after its creation and 
so eventually decays into incapacity.
Deeper magic: it is rumored that some may be able to 
create unlimited undead servants with a limited amount of 
control. The level of control is minimal and limited to very 
simply commands. All the sorcerer requires is a sufficient 
supply of corpses. To determine the number that can be 
created and controlled, divide the caster’s POW by five: 
the result is the maximum number of zombies that may 
be actively controlled at any given time.
Alternative names: The Deathless Servant, Love’s Lost 
Embrace Returned.
