ing time: 1D8+1 rounds
Causes fissures to form in the ground and an eruption of 
molten lava to issue forth. The caster invokes the names of 
various Mythos entities while cutting their flesh, allowing 
their blood to pour onto the ground. After 1D8 rounds, the 
blooded ground erupts with blistering hot lava and steam.
Approximately 1,000 cubic feet of lava is expelled, 
oozing through the cracks in the ground and destroying 
everything it touches. Contact with the lava ignites 
combustibles, melts metal, and causes 1D8 damage per 
round of contact. For each additional 5 magic points 
invested, add 100 cubic feet of additional lava.
Alternative names: The Terrible Heat, Blood Fire, Awful 
Judgment of Kran-Kros.
