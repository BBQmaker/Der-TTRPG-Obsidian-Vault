Causes tens of thousands of common housefly eggs to 
form on the target’s skin. The caster must firmly touch the 
target, and so the spell is usable only against a sleeping, 
held, or otherwise unresisting target (a glancing blow 
during combat doesn’t count). As the eggs quickly hatch, 
the fast-growing larvae consume the victim’s skin and outer round until they are dead. As the cold, clammy shell 
crushes the victim, a Sanity roll is required (0/1D6 loss). 
If a successful Dreaming or Cthulhu Mythos roll is made 
by the target the effect can be cancelled (if they can sacrifice 
magic points equal to one-fifth of their SIZ). Alternatively, 
the target may attempt a Hard STR roll to peel off the foul 
slime (companions may provide aid, reducing the difficulty to 
Regular). Once the slimy clothing is fully removed, it begins 
to dissolve and can cause no further harm. Hopefully the 
now naked victim can find something to wrap-up in quickly!
