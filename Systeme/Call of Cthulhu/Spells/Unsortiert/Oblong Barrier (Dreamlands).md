Oblong Barrier (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  8 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The spell 
creates a complex rectangular pattern of lines, roughly 10 
feet square. The pattern appears directly in front of the 
caster, and remains for 10 rounds before fading away. Any 
attacking spells striking the barrier are blocked, and so the 
caster is warded against such spells as long as the barrier 
is maintained between them and any attacker. Of course, 
the caster cannot cast spells through the barrier either and 
must maintain their concentration otherwise the wall fails.
Alternative names: Counter Ward, Spell Wall, Bulwark of 
Asylum.
