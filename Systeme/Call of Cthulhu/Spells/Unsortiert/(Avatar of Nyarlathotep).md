(Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
• Cost:  12 magic points; 5 POW; 6 Sanity points
• Casting time: 680 seconds
Invoking the dread 680th name of Nyarlathotep, the caster
causes an artifact or living being to become possessed by
an avatar of The Skinless One for 24 hours, or until the
caster dismisses the avatar, or if the caster dies. If the
object to which the avatar is summoned is inanimate, it
takes on certain characteristics of life, including its own
will; if animate, it takes on certain characteristics of dead
matter, including the invulnerability to pain and shock.
The avatar’s characteristics of CON 500, INT 75, and
POW 100 never change; movement is always twice the rate
of the possessed host. Other characteristics and functions
vary with that which is possessed, including Sanity loss
to see, which is never more than 1/5th in points of the
avatar’s apparent SIZ.
Once called, the avatar always adopts and magnifies the
tendencies of that which it is possessing; for example, if
possessing a building, the building becomes larger inside
(impossibly more rooms appear), more secure (light
wooden doors might turn into stoutly solid ones), and
more horrific (hanging pictures might turn into living
entities, or nasty growths, able to attack). Whatever it
possesses, it always finds a way to cause or promote death
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
and destruction—the avatar is inherently “evil”—humanity,
at best, is something to be mocked and twisted.
Note: see Horror on the Orient Express for further
information about the Avatar of the The Skinless One.
Alternative names: Transfiguration of Living Hell.

Call Azathoth 9
Calling this entity is extremely dangerous and foolish; only
the truly insane would even contemplate enacting the spell
as it has the potential to fry the entire planet. The spell
must be cast outside at night.
Despite being mentioned in numerous Mythos texts, the
actual spell is very rare and usually divided into separate
segments (some hidden or obscured by other text) to ensure
it is not so easily or lightly enacted. Often, the spell’s
components are (purposely) incorrectly given or hidden
in highly obscure puzzles.
With such a devastating spell, it is left to the Keeper
to determine the exact components, ritual, and other
paraphernalia required, as best suited to their game or
campaign.
Alternative names: Petition of Chaos, The Unspeakable Vowel
of The Shaggai, Summon the Demi-Urge.

Call Bugg-Shash 9
Sorcerers should be wary of this spell as, it is said, no spell exists to dismiss Bugg-Shash. Some tomes claim that bright light can drive away Bugg-Shash, so this
spell is often cast in areas of complete or near darkness.
A wily entity, the Great Old One is usually reluctant to
converse with the summoner and more likely to attack if no magical restraints (including a suitable sacrifice) have
been prepared for its arrival. Certainly, it will not return to
its home dimension until it has taken at least one victim, which could be the summoner.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
Bugg-Shash.
Alternative names: Bring Forth He Who Comes in Darkness.

Call Cthugha 9
Cthugha bursts into being through a flame held by the
caster (a candle, torch, etc.) or, more likely, a massive
bonfire. As the caster intones the spell, he or she moves
the flame in series of patterns. The spell can be successfully
cast only on clear nights when Fomalhaut (the brightest
star in the Piscis Austrinus constellation) clears the horizon. September to November are the best nights for
Fomalhaut in the Northern Hemisphere.
Deeper magic:  a variant spell, known as Summon Cthugha,
calls for the sacrificial burning of at least one unfortunate
person upon a stone altar. This spell suggests to the reader that
it enables the caster to command Cthugha (a form of binding is
mentioned); however, this is an evil lie as the spell is powerless
to bind the Great Old One. Its intent is to summon Cthugha to wreak havoc and pain upon the land.
Alternative names: Evocation of the Fiery Burning Doom,
The Fomalhaut Convention.

Call Cyaegha 9
Rouses Cyaegha from its long slumber. Cyaegha requires a
sacrifice: the deity manifests inside a sacrificial victim, who
transforms into Cyaegha itself. If no sacrifice is present,
the deity manifests inside the caster. Whoever the sacrifice,
they are utterly destroyed by Cyaegha, who may lash out
at everyone present if not properly appeased.
This spell will not function if Cyaegha remains
imprisoned. Cyaegha is said to appear if called atop the
hill of Dunkelhugel, near the village of Freihausgarten,
in central Germany, and then only for a single night.
Some accounts provide conflicting information, stating
that summons may take place at other locations that have housed veneration of the entity.  If cast in places
unconnected to Cyaegha, the spell is liable to fail.
It is written that should the network of Vaeyen statuettes
on Dunkelhugel be broken, the imprisonment spell ceases
to function and Cyaegha may manifest as it wishes. None
of these conditions, or the location of Cyaegha’s prison,
are described in the body of the ritual.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
Cyaegha.
Alternative names: Release the Waiting Dark
Call Daoloth 9
Summons the Outer God Daoloth to appear within
a special pentacle, known as the Pentacle of Planes.
 The caster requires an icon of Daoloth, the skull of a
nightgaunt, two black candles, a metal rod, and rods or
tubes with which to create the Pentacle of Planes. The
Pentacle is said to keep Daoloth’s form from expanding
and engulfing the caster.
To evade the powerful Sanity loss penalty for viewing
Daoloth’s alien form, the spell may be cast in complete
darkness. Any number of people may contribute 1 magic s

point each, and those who know the spell may contribute
some or all of their magic points. The caster loses 1D10
Sanity whether the spell is successfully cast or not. Others
present lose 1D10 Sanity points only if the spell succeeds.
If Daoloth is called without one or more of the above-
mentioned items, the caster risks becoming host to the
Outer God after reciting the spell. The caster’s body is
pulled into Daoloth’s dimension and appears to warp
and change: it flattens and becomes one-dimensional,
folding in on itself. Soon the caster’s body has folded into
a strange geometric form which then begins to expand and
open, releasing Daoloth into this dimension. The caster
is wracked with great pain as their body is drawn into the
alien plane and inhabited by the Outer God. Watching
someone become possessed by Daoloth provokes a Sanity
roll (1/1D10 loss). In returning to its own dimension,
Daoloth destroys the host body.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
Daoloth.
Alternative names: Configuration of the Render of the Veils.

Call El Negro (Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
Calls El Negro, an avatar of Nyarlathotep, to a coven of his
devout followers. The spell must be cast at night but any
location is permissible. The avatar arrives ready to bargain.
El Negro appears as an 18th century rancher, with a pitch-
black face and uncannily handsome good looks (no Sanity
cost), usually astride a great ebony stallion. His worshippers
believe El Negro always provides aid and guidance if asked—
but the cost is always high. If El Negro reveals another of
Nyarlathotep’s masks, a Sanity roll is likely.
Note: see Secrets of Los Angeles for further information
about El Negro.
Alternative names: none known.

Call Ghatanothoa 9
Calls Ghatanothoa, the Lord of the Volcano, to the caster.
The spell alleges it will only work if performed on the
continent of Mu (which some claim is located between
New Zealand and Chile), and only while Mu is above
the waves. Unless summoned in absolute darkness, the
summoner risks life and limb, as gazing upon the Great
Old One’s form turns one’s body into a petrified living
mummy, where the body becomes like hardened leather and
the brain and organs are somehow preserved indefinitely—
yet the consciousness lives on in sanity draining agony.Alternative names: Revocation of T’yog’s Confinement, Raise
Up the Medusa.

Call Gla’aki 9
May only be cast at night and by the edge of a lake or
large body of water. When cast anywhere other than on the
shores of Brichester Lake, England, a shard of the crystal
prison holding the Great Old One on earth must be seated
in the vicinity—otherwise the spell immediately fails with
all magic points and sanity points wasted.
If successful, Gla’aki will rise from the water and emerge
at the shore. If not appeased, the angered entity will likely
attack all those present, attempting to transform them into
more of its undying servants.
Alternative names: Beseech the Master Beneath the Water,
Raise Ga-Luki.

Call Gol-Goroth 9
Requires a consecrated stone monolith, which must be
least 1,000 years old. Most of the megalithic sites in
Europe readily qualify, as does the infamous Black Stone of
Hungary. The ritual calls for bonfires and hours of frenzied
dancing. At least one human sacrifice’s blood must anoint
the stone. If successful, the monstrous toad-like entity
manifests on top of the stone monolith.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
Gol-Goroth.Alternative names: Call Out Master of the Stone.

Call Hastur 9
Calls the deity to nine large blocks of stone arranged in
a V-pattern (always a sign of cult activity!) Each of the
stone blocks requires a volume of nine or more cubic yards.
The spell can be cast only on clear nights when
Aldebaran (in the constellation of Taurus) is above the
horizon (roughly October to March). Each byakhee
present during the performance of Call Hastur provides
+10 percentiles to the chance for success.
If 5 points of POW have been sacrificed into each of
the stone blocks, so that all are enchanted, the stone V
provides +30 percentiles to the chance to cast Summon/
Bind Byakhee.

in Shadow, The Yellow Petition.

Call Horned Man (Avatar of Nyarlathotep) 9
Brings forth the Horned Man, an avatar of Nyarlathotep.
Usually summoned by covens of witches or those eager to
learn the secrets of magic, the Horned Man is believed to
bestow gifts of knowledge. If the Horned Man appears, he
will choose one of the summoners to engage in a private
“dance”. The dance means different things to different
people. For example, the dance may be a literal dance, the
enactment of a blasphemous rite, a passionate embrace, or
another action at the whim of the Horned Man.
Being chosen to dance with the Horner Man grants
+5 POW permanently. What other benefits or costs of
communion with the Horned Man are at the Keeper’s
discretion.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
the Horned Man.
Alternative names: Call Upon Good Puck, The Dance of
Wisdom and Strife, Ye Revelations of Old Nick.

Call Iod 9
This rare and largely forgotten spell brings the Great Old
One Iod to a hilltop. A special warding circle containing
a pentagram must be created before the spell is cast—
failure to do so means certain death for the caster. Anyone
not within the protective circle when Iod is summoned is
immediately attacked, as is anyone leaving the circle while
the Great Old One is present.
With success, a dark shadow forms in the air, which then
dissipates as a blinding light through which Iod arrives.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about Iod.
Alternative names: Summon the Hunter.

Call Ithaqua 9
Focuses the attention of Ithaqua; however, the presence of
the Great Old One may be noticed only as a whirlwind or
strong icy wind. The spell must be cast on an enormous
mound of snow (minimum 10 feet high). Legend states
that the spell may only be performed in the far north of
the world, when temperatures are below freezing. Some
wizards conjecture that Ithaqua might be invoked from
any high, snowy mountain, even those in the South Pole.
Alternative names: The Seven Oaths of the North Wind,
Invoke the Ice God.
Call Nyogtha 9
Invokes the favor of Nyogtha, who appears to grant a boon
to the caster—if Nyogtha deems the caster worthy. The
caster must perform the spell ritual at the entrance to any
cavern (certain tomes hint that all great caverns link to
the one wherein Nyogtha dwells).
Alternative names: Petition Thy Dark Master Through the
Rigorous Chanting and Wailing, Call Favor From HE Who
Dwells Below.

Call Keeper of the Moonlens 9
The Keeper of the Moon-Lens can only be called on
certain nights of the year, when the moon shines through
the Moon-Lens and onto the side of a hill in the town of
Goatswood, England. Although no other restrictions apply,
one or more sacrificial victims should await the Keeper of
the Moon-Lens when it lumbers out of its subterranean
lair. Sacrifices are swallowed whole, to be later reborn as
the mutant Blessed of Shub-Niggurath.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
the Keeper of the Moonlens.
Alternative names: The Rhyme of the Lens, Summons of
the Master.

Call La Llorona 9
This spell calls La Llorona, an avatar of Shub-Niggurath, to
worshippers of the goddess. The spell must be cast at night,
while the moon is waning, and near a fresh-water stream or
lake. No altar or blood sacrifice is required to complete the
spell, although a wailing child grants a +10% to the attempt
to call La Llorona. Once La Llorona appears, the caster
must designate a sacrifice by stating a name or pointing
out the chosen target for the avatar to take. Should this be
left undone, the caster will face her wrath.
Note: see Secrets of Los Angeles for further information
about La Llorona.
Alternative names: Petition of She Who Weeps, The Wailing
Summons of the Drowner.

Call M’nagalah 9
This spell is very rare, believed only to exist in alien “texts,”
as M’nagalah has no known human devotees or cult. The
spell may only be cast at night. A sacrificial victim must
await M’nagalah when it arrives, and the caster should
conceal themselves from the deity’s view, or risk being eaten.
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
M’nagalah.
Alternative names: none known.

Call Mappo No Ryûjin  9
Calls the Great Dragon of Mappo, the Mappo no Ryûjin,
which becomes fully corporeal in order to bring about the
end of the world. In addition to the standard magic point
cost, 1D20 Sanity points are lost by the caster.
May only be cast by an individual holding all three of
the Japanese Imperial Regalia: the Sword of the Billowing
Clouds, the Necklace of Jade, and the Mirror of the Eight
Handed Flower—these three artifacts being of ancient
Muvian origin. Six stone pillars arranged in a keyhole shape
must be constructed, with the top of each carved into a basin
to hold one of the seven Chinese elements. One of six black
jade gyoku (stones) also is placed in each basin. To complete
the spell, the caster sacrifices SIZ 500 points of human blood
from descendants of the Japanese imperial line. The Great
Old One will awaken from its lair in the ruins of Mu and
journey to the caster, while destroying everything in its path,
to herald a new golden age for R’lyeh.
Note: see Secrets of Japan for further information about
Mappo No Ryûjin.
Alternative names: Invoke Herald of the End, Abolish the
Elder Seal and Unleash Leviathan Bringer of Destruction.

Call Ossadogowah 9
May only be cast when the demon star Algol is above
the horizon and visible. If cast upon a stone tower (such
as the tower required for the Contact Yog-Sothoth spell,
page 77), the spell’s chance for success increases by +25
percentiles. Similarly, casting the spell near a marsh or
fresh water causes frogs to join in the chant, increasing
the spell’s chance for success by +10 percentiles.
The spell calls upon Ossadogowah, also known as
Zvilpoggua, and referred to as the “son of Tsathoggua.”
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
Ossadogowah.Alternative names: Produce Son of Tsathoggua.

Call Rlim Shaikorth 9
Rlim Shaikorth, the White Worm, may only be called at
the North or South Poles. The spell text (usually) warns
caster to beware, as the Great Old One is known for
consuming those who attempt to petition its attention.Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
Rlim Shaikorth.
Alternative names: Chant of Lonely Yikilth, Arise Visitation
of the Ice God.

Call Saaitii 9
Saaitii, a little-known Great Old One, is believed to be
summoned when this spell is performed in darkness, and
where a suitable sacrifice is prepared. It is said, in the
Sigsand Manuscript, that Saaitii corrupts and devours the
souls of its sacrifices, possessing them and first driving
them mad. The Manuscript does not appear to provide
the actual spell, but rather a description of its use, as the
existence of this foul creature’s human worshippers has
never been recorded.
Note: see Malleus Monstrorum for further information about
Saaitii.Alternative names: none known.

Call Shub-Niggurath 9
Calls the Outer God to a consecrated stone altar, which
must be positioned in dank wilderness under the open sky.
The spell must be performed at the altar on the dark of
the moon. Each recital of the spell requires fresh blood to
consecrate the altar; bathed in blood amounting to SIZ
200 or more grants +20 percentiles to spell’s success. In
addition, each dark young in attendance provides a further
+10 percentiles.
Alternative names: The Sacred Rites of Union, Bring Forth
The Carnal Desire of the Wood Nymph.
