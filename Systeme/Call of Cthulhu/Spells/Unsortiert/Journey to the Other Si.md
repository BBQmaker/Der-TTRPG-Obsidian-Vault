Journey to the Other Side
• Cost:  15 magic points; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 day
A long ritual whereby the caster chants or performs some other 
ritualized repetition to enter a trance state (an altered state 
of consciousness). Once the altered state has been achieved, 
the caster is able to send his or her “spirit” to another plane of 
existence; which plane may be determined by the caster (if they 
know and comprehend its existence), or could be random—
conceivably, even, to the location of a Mythos deity or perhaps 
the Dreamlands. The trance lasts 1D6+3 hours. Depending on 
where the caster’s spirit sense travels and what it sees, Sanity losses (possibly quite high) are likely. 
Alternative names:  Channel Soul to Other Place, Transport 
Mind, Great Journeying.
