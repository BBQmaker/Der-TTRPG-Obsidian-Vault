ime: 2 hours
Enhances a pharmacological mixture, accelerating its interaction with the subject upon whom it is used. The 
normal speed of effect is increased by a factor of ten (thus, 
a drug requiring 10 hours to take effect is reduced to 1 
hour). For the spell to function properly, the target drug 
must be placed in a container that has been prepared in 
human blood. The casting requires boiling the blood and the 
container together for 2 hours, while chanting incantations.
