• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Shining 
beams of light whirl around the caster’s head, which 
somehow allow the caster to concentrate powerfully. If the 
caster is concentrating on anything, such as maintaining a 
spell, no damage or distraction will cause a break in his or 
her concentration. In addition, the caster becomes immune 
to the following spells while Ironmind is in effect: Woeful 
Itch (page 190), Serviceable Villein ( page 166), Lassitude 
of Phein ( page 135), Ravening Madness ( page 156), and 
Living X (page 138).
The spell costs 4 magic points per five rounds it is 
maintained. 
Alternative names: Immoveable Concentration, Mind Wall, 
Indomitable Intellect.
