ing time: variable rounds
A spell known by serpent folk and devotees of Yig that 
causes a target to suffer as if bitten by a venomous snake. 
Requires the caster to have some part of a poisonous snake 
as a focus (a fang, rattle, or skin); for obvious reasons, 
serpent folk casters need no such focus. 
The caster must be within 30 yards of the target. Magic 
point cost is variable: 5 magic points generates a Mild 
poison (1D10 damage); 10 magic points generates a 
Strong poison (2D10 damage); 20 magic points generates 
a Lethal poison (4D10 damage). Sanity loss and casting time (in rounds) is equal to half the number of magic 
points expended. 
For the spell to take effect the caster must win an 
opposed POW roll with the target: if the target successfully 
resists, he or she takes only half the damage (determined 
by the poison’s severity). Failing to resist, the target takes 
full damage at a rate of 1 hit point per minute or 1 per 
hour (whichever rate the caster desires). As the damage is 
magical in nature, it cannot be further reduced by a CON 
roll (as per standard poison rules). To all appearances the 
victim exhibits the classic symptoms of a deadly snakebite: 
shortness of breath, sweating, chills, swelling or blistering 
of the skin, and so on.
Deeper magic: serpent folk may use a variation of the spell, 
causing snakes to burst from the ground and leap upon 
the target, their fangs digging deep into flesh, where they 
remain until the target is dead.
Alternative names: Doom of Vipers, Bitter Discourse,  
Rancor of Yig.
