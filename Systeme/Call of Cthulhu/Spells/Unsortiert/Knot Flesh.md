Knot Flesh 6
• Cost:  1D8 Sanity points; 2D6 magic points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Causes the bones and flesh of a target’s body part to become 
extremely flexible, twisting and knotting, causing great pain. 
The caster must win an opposed POW roll with the target: 
if successful, one portion of the target’s body (most often 
an arm or a leg) twists and turns like it is a rope until it 
becomes knotted. The effect is incredibly painful requiring 
a CON roll to avoid passing out from shock, and costs the 
target 1D8 damage, as well as the permanent loss of 5 DEX 
(bones do not break, but may be thinned and twisted). The 
target should make a Sanity roll (1/1D6 loss). It is possible 
to knot a victim’s arm or leg around an inanimate object, 
such as a pole or fence, or another person.
The spell may be reversed by the caster (paying the cost 
again) or another who also knows how to perform the 
spell. For those witnessing the horrible twisting of flesh 
and bone a Sanity roll is called for (1/1D4 loss).
Deeper magic: if the caster elects to sacrifice 5 POW at 
the time of casting, the knotting is permanent, requiring 
extensive surgery to correct. In this case, the spell cannot 
be reversed.
