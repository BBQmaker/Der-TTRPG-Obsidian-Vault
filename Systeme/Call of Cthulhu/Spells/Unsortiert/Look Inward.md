Allows the caster to become smaller. Each magic point spent, 
reduces SIZ by 5 points for 1D6+1 rounds. If enough is spent 
to reduce SIZ to zero, the caster must make a successful POW 
roll to avoid being stuck at a reduced, near-microscopic size 
(presumably, after a period of the Keeper’s discretion, they might 
attempt a reversal of the spell). Sanity loss is 1 point for every 
three magic points spent (rounded up). The caster should be 
aware that they could find themselves in a dangerous position 
if they reduce themselves to a tiny size around hungry animals.

flesh (1 point of damage every four minutes). The spell’s 
effects continue for 60 minutes. Unless drastic action is 
taken, death usually follows. Prompt and successful First 
Aid, or simple tactics such as immersion in water or 
kerosene, offer good chances to save the victim and remove 
the infestation. By the end of an hour, the maggots have 
turned into large bloated flies, which promptly fly off.
Being coated with reappearing maggots calls for a Sanity 
roll (1D6/1D10+3 loss). In addition, the victim is unlikely 
to be able to do anything except wail and scream.
Alternative names: The Seething Infestation of Pain, The 
Wriggling Devourers, Dark Myiasis.
