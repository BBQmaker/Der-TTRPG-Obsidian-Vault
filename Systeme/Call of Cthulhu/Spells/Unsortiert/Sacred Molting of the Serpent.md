Sacred Molting of the Serpent Q

ing time: 1 hour
Reduces the age of the caster, offering potential immortality. 
The caster must acquire a “pure soul” (an individual with no 
skill points in Cthulhu Mythos) who is less than 10 years of 
age to serve as a sacrifice. The caster then ritually offers the 
sacrifice in a ceremony using an enchanted knife. The ritual 
drains all of the sacrifice’s blood, which is drunk by the caster. 
Following this foul ceremony, the caster’s skin gradually begins 
to split and peel (the caster loses 5 APP per day following the 
ritual). After three days, the caster can peel away all of their 
old skin completely, taking around three hours to accomplish 
this grisly act (witnesses should make Sanity rolls; 1/1D6 loss). 
Underneath, the caster is significantly younger. For every 10 
POW possessed by the sacrifice, the caster deducts two years 
from their age—thus, a sacrifice with POW 60 would remove 
12 years from the caster.
Originally taught to the ancient serpent folk by Yig, this 
ritual has subsequently been taught to human worshippers 
of Yig. Non-worshippers of Yig attempting this spell may 
be required to fail a Sanity roll (at the Keeper’s discretion) 
in order to go through with the horrific sacrificial ceremony.

Rebirth.
