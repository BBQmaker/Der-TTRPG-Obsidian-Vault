Voorish Sign 8 O
• Cost:  1 magic point; 1 Sanity point
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
An ancient and powerful hand gesture used by wizards 
that benefits the casting of other spells. It may lessen the 
cost, reduce the casting time, or increase the effect a little, 
depending on the spell in question (the precise benefit is 
determined by the Keeper). The Voorish Sign must be cast 
in the round preceding the spell it is enhancing.The Voorish Sign is also rumored to temporarily ward 
against Mythos monsters—such creatures are wary of 
the sign and may hold off an attack until the wizard’s 
intentions are known.
Alternative names: Sign of Power, Cunninge Pass.
