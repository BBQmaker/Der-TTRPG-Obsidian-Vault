Enchant Flesh M
• Cost:  10 magic points; 2D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5+ minutes 
Allows the caster to preserve and ensorcell 5 SIZ points of the skin and flesh of a victim (more flesh can be enchanted at multiples of the spell’s costs). The flesh must be cut away 
with an enchanted knife and immediately thereafter the spell 
must be cast upon the skin. The block of flesh enchanted is 
now immune to most forms of damage (firearms still do 
minimum damage; enchanted weapons do normal damage). 
Furthermore, the flesh will age instead of the caster, adding 
one year to his or her life. Unless applied with a Graft Flesh  
spell (page 125), the enchanted flesh lasts a number of weeks 
equal to one-fifth of the original owner’s POW, after that it 
loses its magical properties and decays. If Graft Flesh is used, 
the flesh lasts forever. Nominally, 10–11 such flesh blocks 
THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
can completely “armor” an average-sized human—the caster 
building this horrific “suit” over the course of many days.
Deeper magic: this is a very rare spell and a jealously 
guarded secret of a handful of wizards.
