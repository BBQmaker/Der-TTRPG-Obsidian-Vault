Red Sign, The 6
• Cost: 3 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points; 1 hit point 
per round
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
An awful spell that causes one or several targets to die horribly. 
The caster inscribes in the air the dreaded Red Sign, while 
speaking words of power. When formed correctly, a dull red 
symbol glows in the air as the caster’s finger describes it. The 
sign’s malevolent effects manifest the round after its creation. 
Once formed, the sign must be maintained by concentration (the 
caster needing to stand nearby) and the additional expenditure 
of 3 magic points for each additional round beyond the second. 
The caster also loses 1 hit point each round beyond the second 
because of their proximity to the sign.
All those within 10 yards of the sign lose 1D3 hit points per 
round as their bodies quake and spasm, and their internal organs 
and blood vessels convulse. Those further than 10 yards but 
nearer than 30 yards lose 1 hit point each round. Those further 
than 30 yards take no damage. It is possible to escape the sign’s 
effect by crawling behind a stout wall or other opaque barrier. 
Deeper magic: the caster may empower the Red Sign further 
by investing 5 POW into its creation. This done, the sign 
causes 1D6 hit points loss per round to those within 10 yards 
and 2 hit points loss to those within 30 yards. Alternatively, 
the caster may elect to cause the Sign to expel its dark energy 
in a single blast. The caster creates the Sign as usual and 
invests it with 10 POW. On 1D4 rounds following, the Sign 
will explode in blaze of red light causing 2D8 damage to 
everything within 50 yards (including the caster).
