Dominate 6
• Cost:  1 magic point; 1 Sanity point
• Casting time: instantaneous
Bends the will of the target to that of the caster. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. If successful, the target obeys the commands of the caster without exception until the next round concludes.
The spell can affect only one individual at a time and has a maximum range of 10 yards. Obviously the command or commands must be intelligible to the target; the spell may be broken if a command contradicts the target’s basic nature (such as instructing a human to fly).
Dominate can be cast and recast as many times as the caster finds possible, allowing a target to be controlled without interruption for several minutes. Each casting of the spell hasn the same costs and limits. Recasting is instantaneous.

Alternative names: Command of the Wizard, The Chant of Possession, Baleful Influence, Speake to the Inner Voice.
