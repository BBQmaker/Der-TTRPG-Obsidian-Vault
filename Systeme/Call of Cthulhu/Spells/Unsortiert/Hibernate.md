only be cast on a willing target. The caster must touch the 
forehead of the target, saying a short phrase. The target 
falls to the floor in deep slumber and dreams endlessly. 
With the expenditure of 5 magic points, the sleep lasts for 
one year; if 10 magic points are spent, the sleep lasts ten 
years; for 15 magic points, it lasts 100 years. The target 
retains a modicum of perception; if clear danger presents 
itself, they may awaken with a successful Luck roll, though 
the spell is thereby broken.
