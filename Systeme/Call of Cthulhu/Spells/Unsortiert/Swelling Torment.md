Swelling Torment 6
• Cost:  3+ magic points; 3D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
A magical attack that expands the target’s brain tissue, 
causing intense pain. The caster must be able to see the 
target and win an opposed POW roll. If successful, waves 
of pain cause the target to become incapacitated, while 
blood pours from their ears, nose, and eyes—it feels as 
if their brain is about to explode. The target also suffers 
1D3 damage. The spell can be prolonged by the caster 
concentrating on the target (to the exclusion of everything 
else) and expending a further 3 magic points per round.
Permanent brain damage is possible. If the spell is 
sustained for three rounds (and for each consecutive set 
of three round thereafter) the target must make a POW 
roll: if failed, the target permanently loses 5 points of INT. 
Should the target be reduced to zero hit points, their 
brain liquefies with a sickening squelch and pours out as a 
grey-red soup from their noses and ears—witnessing this 
horror provokes a Sanity roll (0/1D4 loss).
Alternative names: Assault of the Intellect, The Red Torment.
