ing time: 3 rounds
Interferes with the binding of a Mythos creature, causing 
it to return to and attack the person who originally 
summoned it. The caster makes an opposed POW roll with 
the original summoner (the caster who summoned and/or 
bound the monster). If the caster wins, the creature will be 
compelled to return to and attack its original master with 
due haste. The spell has no effect against unbound entities. 
Deeper magic: variations of this rare spell target the 
binding of different Mythos creatures, each spell is specific to the monster type. Dark whispers tell that 
many transcriptions of such variant spells are purposefully 
incorrect—perhaps devised by those both mad and 
insidiously wicked. In some instances, if time and ability 
allow, the original summoner could attempt to recast 
the binding spell to regain control of the creature—the 
difficulty of this process may result in a higher spell cost and success is not necessarily guaranteed. 
Alternative names: Intercession of Authority, Claim Mastery 
of Star Spawn, Interlope Binding.
