(Call Cyaegha variant) 9
• Cost:  5 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: variable hours
Allows the caster to contact Cyaegha, the One in Darkness. 
It requires a special room or place be prepared, which must 
be devoid of all furnishings, coated in black paint or soot, 
and any windows or doors must be covered so no light can 
enter. In the center of the room the caster sits and intones 
the spell, requiring a successful Hard POW roll. Once the 
spell is begun, the caster sits quietly and stares into the 
darkness for several hours. If, at any time, light is allowed 
to enter the room, or the caster leaves, then the spell is 
broken and no contact will be made. After an unspecified 
amount of time an image of the huge green eye of Cyaegha 
will form in the center of the room, floating in mid-air 
(provoking a Sanity roll for 1D4/1D10 loss). At this point, 
contact is established (which may in and of itself lead to 
further Sanity loss).
