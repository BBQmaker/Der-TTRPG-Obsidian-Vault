### Enchant Magic Staves
• Cost:  25 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
• Casting time: 1 month
An ancient enchantment, said to have been devised by
Nephren Ka himself, creates a pair of magical staves: one
tipped with the traditional Egyptian crook, and the other
with an inverted ankh. The caster must personally carve and
fashion the staves (requiring a successful Art/Craft roll),
and then perform a month-long ritual to enchant them. The
ritual requires rare components (circa $500+), including great
amounts of Paut (see Brew Paut, page 49), and a sacrifice
of 25 POW. Once enchanted, the staves confer 2D10 extra
magic points to the bearer of the staves (if held crossed in
front of the bearer’s body). Spells cast by the bearer expend
these additional magic points first. Additionally, the crossed
staves will absorb 1D10 points of damage inflicted by any
damage-causing spell cast at the bearer. The capacities of
these staves recharge 24 hours after use.
