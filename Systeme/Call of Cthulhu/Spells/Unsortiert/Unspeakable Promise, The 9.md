ing time: 1 hour per Sanity point lost
Establishes a binding oath to He Who Is Not To Be 
Named. In return, Hastur grants the caster some benefit—a 
plausible gift may be an important ancient tome, such as 
the R’lyeh Text, the yearly award of 15 POW for the rest of 
the recipient’s life, or an increase in the Cthulhu Mythos 
skill. Additionally, however, there is a non-cumulative 
chance of 2% per year that the caster transforms into a 
gruesome humanoid monster totally under Hastur’s sway—
the Keeper creates the monster’s characteristics and the 
being comes under the Keeper’s control.
Alternative names: The Yellow Gift, The Unbreakable Vow 
to He Who Is Not To Be Named.
