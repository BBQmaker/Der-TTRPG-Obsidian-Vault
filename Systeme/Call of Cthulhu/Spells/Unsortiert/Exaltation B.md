Exaltation B O
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
Floods the target with a soul-lifting feeling of wellbeing, 
granting the target Sanity points. With an impassioned 
appeal, lasting five rounds, and the caster winning an 
opposed POW roll with the target, the spell temporarily 
increases the target’s Sanity by 1D6 points for every 12 
magic points invested by the caster. Such additional Sanity 
points are lost after 24 hours, or until lost by other means. 
The sudden acquisition of extra Sanity points may result in relief from temporary insanity. Where the target is suffering from indefinite insanity, 
the caster may sacrifice 5 POW to have the 1D6 Sanity 
point gain be permanent (although, such points can be 
lost through Sanity shattering experiences).
The spell may be cast on a sleeping target, causing them 
to experience a wonderful dream and restful sleep.
Alternative names: Calm Mind, Infuse the Blessed Relief of 
Troubles Past, Barricade of Perception.
