ing time: 1+ day
Enchants a portrait allowing its viewers to communicate 
with its subject. Some of the subject’s blood must be mixed 
with the oils used in painting the portrait. The caster 
does not need to paint the portrait (especially if they are 
not artistically inclined), but he or she must be present 
throughout its creation. Once the painting is complete 
(use an Art/Craft roll to determine its quality), the caster 
enchants the finished piece.
Any viewer gazing into the eyes of the portrait may 
attempt a POW roll: if successful, they open telepathic 
communication to the subject, wherever they may be. Both 
viewer and subject can only hear one another. This effect 
costs the viewer 5 magic points and 1 Sanity point, and 
then 1 magic point thereafter for every minute of contact. 
Contact ends when the viewer chooses not to expend any 
more magic points in maintaining contact. 
If the subject of the portrait is dead, an enchanted 
painting becomes a dangerous trap. If contact is established 
with the spirit of the deceased, it costs the viewer 10 magic s

spoints and 1D3 Sanity points. The spirit of the deceased 
can attempt to possess the viewer. After one minute of 
communication, for each subsequent round, the spirit and 
the viewer make an opposed POW roll: the loser suffers the 
loss of 2D10 POW. If the spirit is reduced to zero POW, 
it is destroyed, and the portrait loses its enchantment 
forever. If the viewer is reduced to zero POW, their soul 
is consumed and the spirit takes permanent possession of 
their body, granting them a second chance at life.
