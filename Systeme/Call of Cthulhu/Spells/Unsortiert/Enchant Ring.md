Enchant Ring M

ime: 1 week
The ring must be fashioned from a bone taken from a living sacrifice. Mythos sigils are carved into the ring. Wearing the ring grants a magical armor of 8 points against projectiles and melee attacks. Note that fire, 
drowning, poison, and other non-weapon attacks ignore 
the magical armor, as do magical weapons.
A key side effect of using the ring is a growing 
cannibalistic urge. Each time the ring is worn for a full 
day, the wearer loses 1D3 Sanity points, and must succeed 
with an Extreme POW roll or succumb to cannibalistic 
predilections for 1D4 hours (which may provoke further 
Sanity loss).
