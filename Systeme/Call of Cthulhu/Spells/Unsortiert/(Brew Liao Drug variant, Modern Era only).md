This is a variant of the Brew Liao Drug spell (see page 
47) synthesized to be a cross between Liao and ketamine, 
which have numerous chemical structural similarities. Para-kete costs $1,000 per dose to make. Casting this 
spell requires knowledge of the Brew Liao Drug spell.
Note: ketamine was first synthesized in 1962 and is not available to wizards before this date. In the Modern Era, 
ketamine is common in the illicit drug trade.
The difference between Liao and Paraketamine (“para-
kete”) is that para-kete always sends the mind drifting back 
through time. Para-kete is also highly addictive. After the 
first dose, the user craves more. After one use, the character 
needs to make a POW roll to resist using it again (if it is 
available). After the second use, the character must make a 
Hard POW roll. Once a third dose is taken, the character 
must make an Extreme POW roll every day to prevent them 
from actively seeking the drug that day. Regular ketamine 
can be used to quench the cravings. If the addiction cannot 
be satisfied, apply a one-step difficulty to all skills rolls for 
3D6 weeks. These cravings do not go away for six months. 
Taking more ketamine will allow the character to function. 
To be cured of para-kete’s chronic mind-rotting properties, 
the character must check into a rehab program and be out 
of action for three months. Further use means the character 
is immediately addicted once more.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, or 
Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure that brewing 
directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names: none known.
