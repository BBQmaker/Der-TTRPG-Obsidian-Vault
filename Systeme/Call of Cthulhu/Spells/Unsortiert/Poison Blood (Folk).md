Poison Blood (Folk) 0
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 2 weeks
Exposes the target to an infectious agent. After two weeks 
preparing a foul ointment, the caster must touch the target 
with the ointment to instigate the infection. Symptoms start 
after a 12 hour incubation period and cost the target 1D3 
hit points per day for 1D3 days, plus the discomfort of fever, 
chills, nausea, a feeling of dread, rashes in uncomfortable 
places, and so forth (possibly increasing the difficulty level 
of some skill rolls, or imposing a penalty die, at the Keeper’s 
discretion). For each additional 2 magic points invested 
at the time of casting the spell continues for another day. 
Medical intervention is unlikely to help the target of the 
spell, as the poisoning is magical in nature and its cause 
cannot be determined or understood by contemporary medical 
practitioners. Certain blessings and healing rituals may provide 
limited succor or completely negate the spell’s effect.
At the Keeper’s discretion: a successful Cthulhu Mythos, 
Occult, or Art/Craft (Potions) roll may be needed to ensure 
that directions are carefully followed.
Alternative names: Poison Touch, The Dread, Blight.
