Dionysian Revels C B
• Cost:  2 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 minutes
Originally used by priests of Dionysius to whip other 
worshippers into frenzy. The caster must make a successful 
Art/Craft (Sing, Dance, Musical Instrument, etc.) to begin 
their dance. They then begin casting the spell as they weave 
their way through the revelers. Each person witnessing 
this dance must make an opposed POW roll against the 
caster or they too begin dancing without heed to their 
surroundings or circumstances for 1D10 hours. For each 
hour of such exertion, a reveler must make a Hard CON roll or fall unconscious.
Once satisfied with the revels they have engendered, the 
caster may sacrifice an additional magic point to break 
free of the dance; the other dancers must continue until 
the spell expires or they collapse. For every dancer who 
collapses, the caster gains 1D4 magic points, as long as 
they remain within sight of the revelry.
Alternative names: Lord of the Dance, Connivance of Frolics, 
The Unending Revelry.
