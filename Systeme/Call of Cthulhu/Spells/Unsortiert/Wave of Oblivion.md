Wave of Oblivion b
• Cost:  30 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points•
 Cast
ing time: 1 hour
A mighty spell that causes a powerful ocean wave to smash 
down at the caster’s direction. The caster must be able to 
see the intended target location and sufficient quantities 
of salt water must be present to create the wave. The caster 
stands in the water to cast the spell.
The wave volume is 3,000 cubic feet, enough to swamp 
or capsize a small sloop. Needless to say, people swallowed 
up by such waves vanish forever below the surface.
Others can contribute magic points to the spell to create 
vast waves capable of sinking ocean liners, battleships, or 
Manhattan Island. Those knowing the spell can contribute 
as many magic points as desired and must expend 1D8 
Sanity points. Those who do not know the spell can 
contribute 1 magic point each. At a minimum of 30 magic 
points, the wave is ten feet long, ten feet wide, and thirty feet high. Each additional magic point adds a foot to the length and width of the wave.
Alternative names: Song of the Ocean’s Fist, The Salt Gift, 
Ye Watery Doom.
