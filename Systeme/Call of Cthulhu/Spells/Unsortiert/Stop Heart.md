Stop Heart C
• Cost:  14 magic points; 2D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round 
Causes the target of this spell to suffer a massive heart 
attack. While the spell takes but a single round to cast, the 
caster must have spent at least one day preparing the spell 
(during the week before the spell is cast). The preparation 
involves an intense ritual where the caster purges their 
mind and body. Once purged, the spell may be cast anytime 
in the following seven days. For the spell to take effect 
the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with 
the target, who must be in the caster’s line of sight. If 
successful, the target loses 4D6 hit points and, if still alive, 
is incapacitated for 2D10 rounds.
Deeper magic: in a hideous twist to the standard version 
of this spell, the victim’s still beating heart is summoned 
to the caster’s hand (from a distance of up to 100 feet). 
Death is inevitable.
Alternative names: Grasp the Beating Heart of the 
Unbeliever, The Bloody Hand, The Word of Death.
