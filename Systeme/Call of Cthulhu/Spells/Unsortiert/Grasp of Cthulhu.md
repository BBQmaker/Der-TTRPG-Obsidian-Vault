Grasp of Cthulhu 6
• Cost: 2D6 magic points (per minute); 1D6 Sanity 
points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Immobilizes one or more targets with a terrible, crushing 
pressure, temporarily robbing STR.  The spell’s range is 
10 yards and may affect more than one person at a time; 
however, each additional target costs an additional 2D6 
magic points per minute the spell is sustained—can be 
extended for as many minutes as the caster’s magic points 
can buy without additional Sanity point cost, but the caster 
must concentrate on the spell during the entire time. 
For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an 
opposed POW roll with the target(s): if the caster wins, 
the victim(s) feels great pressure bearing down upon his 
or her body and is unable to move—as though wrapped 
by the mighty tentacles of Great Cthulhu. 
For each minute the spell lasts, the target temporarily loses 
5D10 STR points. If the target’s STR drops to zero or 
less, he or she falls unconscious.

Deeps, The Smothering, The Gift of R’lyeh.
