ing time: instantaneous
May be directed at any individual within direct sight or 
hearing. If the target fails an opposed POW roll with 
the caster, they suffer from partial impairment to their 
thinking processes for 2D10 minutes. The effect could be 
seen as diverting a particular line of questioning, causing 
an argument to break out, cause the target to “accidentally” 
walk into traffic or off the end of a pier, or make the 
target forget what they were doing (in combat this could 
prove lethal).
Alternative names: Befuddle, Dumbfound, Bewildering Gaze.
