 Cast
ing time: 24 hours (1 round to apply)
Creates a magical powder that temporarily exposes an alien 
entity inhabiting the target’s mind or body. Anyone can use 
the created powder. When sprinkled over a human and a 
word of power is spoken, the powder reveals the possessing 
entity for one round.
In creating the powder a glass ground from a mirror 
at least 100 years old is required, as is a handful of gold 
dust and two special ingredients (Keeper’s choice). The 
caster then meditates silently for a day and a night in 
a cave or other lightless place. Once his or her mind is 
clear, the caster combines the ingredients, adds the blood 
of a mammal, utters a short incantation, and invests 
the spell’s costs. The vessel’s contents should burst into 
flame, indicating that the spell has been successful. If 
unsuccessful, the magic points are lost and the ritual may 
be begun anew. To determine success, the caster must 
succeed in a POW roll. 
The result is a fine grey-blue powder as soft as fresh 
wood ash. It keeps indefinitely.
A pinch or two is enough; sprinkled, blown, or thrown 
over a target, the form of any possessing foreign entity 
becomes visible as a life-size shadow superimposed over 
the host; the shadow vanishes at the end of the round. 
Any resultant Sanity loss from seeing the shadowy entity 
is halved. 
The powder would reveal Y’golonac, a member of the 
Great Race, or an insect from Shaggai. Serpent people 
using the Consume Likeness spell (page 72) would not 
be revealed by this spell, nor would people of ghoulish 
tendency, vampires, or shape-changers.
