Nyhargo Dirge (Resurrection variant) 8 6
• Cost:  6 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1 round
Destroys a single undead. A modified version of the 
Resurrection spell (page 160) used to destroy corporeal 
undead, such as a skeleton, zombie, vampire, and the like. 
The caster sings an eerie, droning chant in the presence 
of the undead creature, who must succeed in an opposed 
POW roll with the caster or immediately turn to dust.
Deeper magic: allegedly, a more powerful version of this 
spell allows the caster to target a group of undead in single 
moment (up to 8 per casting); however, the cost is greater: 
20 magic points and 1D10 Sanity points, as well as the 
permanent sacrifice of 5 POW.
Alternative names: Destroy Zombie, Chant of Eradication.
