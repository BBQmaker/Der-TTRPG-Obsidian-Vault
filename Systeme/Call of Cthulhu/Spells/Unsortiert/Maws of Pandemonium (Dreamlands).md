Maws of Pandemonium (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 3 rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. The spell’s 
target sprouts gibbering mouths; costing 6 magic points per 
mouth created. The caster must win an opposed POW roll 
with the target: if successful, the target’s body sprouts one 
or more red-lipped mouths which constantly gibber and 
moan. In addition, the mouths drain magic points at the 
rate of 1 per minute. Once reduced to zero magic points the 
target falls unconscious—the victim may attempt a POW 
roll at this point: with an Extreme success, the mouths seal 
up and disappear while they sleep. Otherwise, the mouths 
simply become quiet for 2D6 hours. Then, they once again 
begin to howl and drain whatever magic points have been 
regenerated in the interim. The victim may attempt to make 
the Extreme POW roll to remove the mouths every time 
they are drained to zero magic points and collapse.
Note that Stealth rolls and other attempts at covert 
action are useless as long as the mouths are active. 
Alternative names: The Screaming Curse, Unholy Sprouting, 
Gibbering Calamity.
