An ancient magical symbol of mysterious origin, the Sign of 
Koth may be related to the infamous Yellow Sign. The ritual to form and empower the Sign of Koth requires the sacrifice 
of a human of POW 60 or more. The Sign can be inscribed on 
any surface using paint or ink, or by physically carving it onto 
a desired surface. The Sign’s POW equals that of the sacrifice 
plus the amount of POW invested by the caster (minimum of 
5). Once empowered, the Sign cannot be defaced: if painted over, the foul symbol will bleed through within a day, and all 
other attempts to mar it will prove fruitless. The Sign can only 
be harmed by magical means, and then only if the would-be destroyer can win an opposed POW roll against the Sign.
The Sign has several powers. Anyone who stares at the 
Sign and meditates can see visions of various Mythos 
locales (the Plateau of Leng, the Mysterious Inner City 
of the Magnetic Poles, and the Dread Tower of Koth, 
etc.). The visions last a minute per magic point spent by 
the viewer, and will cost variable Sanity loss depending on 
the vision seen (entities seen via the Sign cost additional 
Sanity points). The viewer gains +1 percentile of Cthulhu 
Mythos for every five minutes spent viewing the darkest 
corners of the universe, and a successful Cthulhu Mythos 
roll allows the viewer to control the locale viewed. 
Additionally, the Sign of Koth acts as a powerful ward 
against “creatures of nightmare” and the undead. Zombies 
and resurrected entities are held at bay by the Sign. Any 
creature native to the Dreamlands must succeed in an opposed POW roll against the Sign in order to cross it or 
pass through a warded doorway, while undead (including the resurrected) cannot pass it at all.
Deeper magic: portions of the Necronomicon suggest that 
the Sign may also be used to physically travel to fabulous 
places if the viewer knows the proper mantras.
Alternative names: none known.
