Fire Dance 6
• Cost:  variable magic points; 3 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
Causes a ball of flame to leap from an existing fire to a 
designated target. For each magic point invested (to a total 
of 6), the cabbage-sized ball of fire can leap roughly 15 s 

yards (thus the maximum range for such a fireball is about 
90 yards). The spell takes one minute to cast for each magic 
point sacrificed. Motionless targets are automatically it. 
Moving targets may attempt a Hard Dodge roll to avoid the 
flames. Living targets hit suffer 1D6 damage and must roll 
Luck to determine if caught on fire (if so, they suffer 2 points 
of damage per round thereafter until the fire is put out).
Alternative names: The Burning Sprite, Word of Cthugha, 
Jack O’ Flame.
