To bring a vision of Chuma (the name sub-Saharan tribes 
give to Yibb-Tstll), from the Dreamlands to the Waking 
World, the casters must present him or herself before an 
image of the god during the early hours of the evening 
and under an open sky. The spell requires a living sacrifice, 
which need not be human, but must be “equivalent in size 
and capacity” (have a POW of at least 50).
As the spell is cast, the image begins to revolve; all 
who witness it must make a Sanity roll (1D3/1D6 loss). 
Whether the summons is completely successful depends 
on the number of magic points invested, for every 8 magic 
points invested, the chance to summon a vision of Chuma 
is 10% (attendees may contribute magic points). As the 
spell progresses, the image spins faster and faster. At the 
same time, Yibb-Tstll’s blood floats down from the sky 
and covers the sacrifice, draining 5 POW from it every 30 
minutes. When the sacrifice’s POW reaches zero, Yibb-Tstll 
manifests in their body for a brief period, before retiring. In 
some cases, the sacrifice remains alive after being inhabited, 
but usually this is not the expected outcome.
Note: see Call Deity Spells (page 53).
