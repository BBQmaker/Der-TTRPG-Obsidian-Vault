flesh; 1D4 Sanity points
• Cost: (living flesh) 5 magic points per 15 SIZ of living 
flesh; 1D6 Sanity points
• Casting time: 5 rounds
This devilish spell heats flesh (dead or living) to its melting 
point in one round. If used on animate flesh, the cost 
is substantially higher to the caster. The target’s flesh is 
melted, causing horrific disfigurement (1D4 damage per 
15 SIZ points affected). In certain cases, such as where the 
face is targeted, the target may become blind or lose the 
ability to hear, and possibly suffocate unless air vents can 
be quickly created. Seeing human flesh melt off human 
bones costs 1/1D6 Sanity points.
Alternative names: Rite of Dissolution, Liquefy Skin.
