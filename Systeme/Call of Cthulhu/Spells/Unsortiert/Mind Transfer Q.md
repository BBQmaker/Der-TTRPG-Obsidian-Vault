Mind Transfer Q n
• Cost:  10 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds or more
A powerful spell allowing the caster to permanently trade 
minds with a target, perhaps to attain longer life at the 
target’s expense. For the spell to take effect the caster must 
succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. With 
success, the caster loses 1D10 Sanity points and the target 
loses 2D10 Sanity points. If the exchange fails, the caster 
must immediately cast the spell again (losing 10 more 
magic points) or his or her soul dissipates into eternity. 
Once the transfer is begun, it cannot be broken off.
A successful casting means that the caster has 
permanently taken control of the target’s body. The caster’s 
previous body is now a hollow, dead thing. As for the mind 
of the target, conjecture suggests that it is expelled from 
the body and thus dies; however, some hint that it remains 
inside its own body, subservient to the caster’s mind and 
locked in a permanent state of horrific madness. 
Deeper magic: the dark will of wizards is a mighty thing, 
often transcending the very grave. Wizards, fearful of 
death or eager to ensure longevity, may prepare the Mind 
Transfer spell many years in advance of its casting. Such 
preparations usually concern some personal item (such as 
portrait or dairy), wherein the spell is keyed, awaiting the 
right conditions for it to come to fruition. Oft time, the 
key is found by some future descendant of the caster, who 
unknowingly or willingly activates the spell.

of the Blood, Soul Possession.
