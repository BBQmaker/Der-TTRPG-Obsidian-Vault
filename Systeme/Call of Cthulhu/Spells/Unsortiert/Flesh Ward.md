Flesh Ward 2
• Cost:  variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 5 rounds
Grants protection against physical attack. Each magic point spent provides the caster (or the chosen target) 
1D6 points of armor against non-magical attacks. This 
protection wears off as it blocks damage; for example, if 
a character had 12 points of Flesh Ward and was hit for 
8 points of damage, the Flesh Ward would be reduced to 
4 points, although no damage would be taken. The spell 
lasts 24 hours or until the protection is depleted. Once cast, 
the spell may not be reinforced with further magic points, 
nor recast until the old spell’s protection has been used up.
Alternative names: Protect Thee from Mighty Blows, Armor 
of the Will, Blood Shield.
