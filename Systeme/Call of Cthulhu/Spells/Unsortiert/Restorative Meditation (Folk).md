ing time: 1 month
A Tibetan technique that provides mental restoration 
through long mediation. Practitioners isolate themselves 
from all worldly influence for a period of at least one 
month, during which time they must only focus upon isolated mediation and ritual purification. At the end 
of this time of deep contemplation, they can attempt to 
make a Sanity roll: if successful, they have 1D6 Sanity 
points restored. Points recovered with this technique can 
never exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 
game mechanics of 99 minus their Cthulhu Mythos skill percentage.
Note that the result of a fumbled Sanity roll means 
that the mediation has been corrupted, with the person’s 
thoughts being twisted to focus on and relive the mental 
anguish previously suffered. Such unfortunates lose 1D6 
Sanity points rather than gain them.
Alternative names: Mantra of Wellness, Peace of the Namaste.
