Shrivelling 6
• Cost:  variable magic points; variable Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous 
A powerful offensive spell causing physical injury to a target. 
The caster invests as many magic points as desired and that 
number halved in Sanity points. For the spell to take effect the 
caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. 
If successful, the target is subjected to a sudden and terrifying 
blast of energy, causing flesh to blacken and wither. The target 
loses 1 hit point per magic point invested in the spell. 
Deeper magic: calling up the powerful energies of the 
Mythos is one thing; shaping them through understanding 
and comprehension is another. Some casters are able to 
inflict this spell without the need for a POW roll. In 
addition, the caster may elect to induce further mental 
terror: while reeling from the energy blast, the target 
believes that he or she is being assaulted by horrific Mythos 
entities, provoking a Sanity roll for 1/1D6 Sanity loss.
Alternative names: Shriving, The Withering Blast of Death,.
