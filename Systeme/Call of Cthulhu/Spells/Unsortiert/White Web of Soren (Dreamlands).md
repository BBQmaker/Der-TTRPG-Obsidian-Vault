White Web of Soren (Dreamlands) H
• Cost:  4+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
•
 Cast
ing time: 1+ rounds
This spell may only be cast in the Dreamlands. Forms 
thick, white ribbon-like strands of matter to wrap around 
the target, which can be up to 10 yards away. The spell 
costs 4 points per strand created and it takes one round to 
create each strand. For each strand that wraps around the 
target, roll a cumulative 1D10: when the total of the rolls 
exceeds one-fifth of the target object’s SIZ, it begins to 
look transparent. The instant that the total of the 1D10 
rolls exceed half the target object’s SIZ, the object, strands 
and all, vanish in a puff of smoke and a flash of light. 
If the target is a living creature, the strands prevent 
movement—a successful opposed STR roll versus the sum 
of the 1D10 rolls multiplied by 5 allows the strands to 
be broken (thus, it get harder to escape as more strands 
constrict). After ten rounds, if the target has not yet vanished, the strands begin to evaporate at the rate of 
one per round.
As to where in the Dreamlands vanished objects and 
people appear is something left to the Keeper to determine.
