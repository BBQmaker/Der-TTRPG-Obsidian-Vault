Vanish (Gate Boxes variant) 6
• Cost: 5 magic points; 1 Sanity point; (10 POW one-
time cost)
•
 Cast
ing time: instantaneous
The caster vanishes in a puff of smoke, to reappear in a 
prepared location. The location is defined by creating a 
single Gate Box (page 120). Once the box  is prepared, 
the caster sacrifices 10 POW (a one-time cost) and places 
elements of their body inside the box (such as blood, 
teeth, or nails); if these elements are removed and the box 
purified, the spell will not work, requiring the sorcerer to 
prepare the box one again (and repay the cost).
When a certain phrase or gesture is performed, the 
caster is immediately transported to inside the Gate box, 
wherever it may be. The location of the Gate box might 
be as far as several hundred miles distant. Presumably the 
box could be moved without the sorcerer’s knowledge─a 
surprise on their arrival! Each time the caster travels in 
this manner it costs 5 magic points and 1 Sanity point.
Alternative names: The Wizard’s Exit, Return Thee to 
Safety, Bodily Evaporation.
