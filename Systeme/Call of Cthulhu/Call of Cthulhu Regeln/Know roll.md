### Know roll
All people know bits of information about different topics. The Know roll represents what’s stored in the brain’s intellectual attic, calculated as the percentage chance that the investigator’s education supplied the information. Roll equal to or under a character’s EDU value to determine the success of a Know roll.
The investigator might know it is dangerous to pour water into sulfuric acid (without studying Chemistry), or be able to remember the geography of Tibet (without a Navigate roll), or know how many legs arachnids have (and possess only a point of Biology).
Identification of present-day earthly languages is an excellent use for the Know roll. If a specific skill is more applicable to the situation, then it should be used rather than making a Know roll (at the Keeper’s discretion).
