Initial Reading

The next step, beyond looking at the cover, reading the title (if it has one that can be read) and determining the language in which the book is written, is to make an initial reading. To continue the analogy used above, this is where the investigator is exposed to the fire within. An initial reading can be swift and may represent the reader only having skimmed the book sufficient to gain some insight regarding its contents, or it may be a cover-to-cover reading. An initial reading can take as much time as the Keeper wishes; this may be minutes, hours, days or weeks, depending on how the Keeper wants to shape the story.
Whether a reading roll is called for is up to the Keeper, who may choose to grant automatic success to anyone with a modicum of skill in the appropriate language.
To make a reading roll, the player makes an appropriate Language skill roll on 1D100. The Keeper decides on a difficulty level for reading the book based upon its age, form and condition Table XI: Mythos Tomes, pages (@@-@@).
A book printed within the last century and in good condition would be of Regular difficulty.
A handwritten work is likely to be of a Hard difficulty level, especially if it is old.
The most challenging of ancient, moldering tomes, containing a mix of print and handwritten annotation, would be Extreme difficulty level.

If the investigator fails the reading roll, they perhaps gets some inkling as to the content of the book, but have failed to comprehend it; no [[Sanity points]] are lost and no Cthulhu Mythos skill is gained. The player may ask to push the roll, but must justify doing so, perhaps staying up all night reading or using reference books as an aid to study. When
thinking of consequences for failing a pushed reading roll, the Keeper should be creative and include Sanity point loss. If in no hurry, they may continue to read the book without pushing the roll. The timing of the next reading roll is at the Keeper’s discretion (perhaps once per week).
The Table XI: Mythos Tomes (pages @@-@@) indicates the Cthulhu Mythos skill points and Sanity point loss for each tome. Each tome has two values for Cthulhu Mythos: CMI (Cthulhu Mythos Initial) showing how many Cthulhu Mythos skill points are given for an initial reading, and CMF (Cthulhu Mythos Full) that shows how many points are given for full study of the tome.
Once the investigator has made an initial reading, the Keeper should reward them with the initial reading (CMI) number. A roll should now be made for Sanity point loss; note that the Sanity roll is bypassed when reading a tome the Sanity point loss is automatic.
As well as gaining Cthulhu Mythos skill and losing [[Sanity points]], the initial reading also allows the reader to learn about the contents of book and gain some idea of what spells it might contain. The reader will also have a clear idea of how long it will take to complete a full study of the book

Full Study

A full study of a Mythos tome indicates a comprehensive reading as one might make when studying an academic work, or as a religious adherent might make of a sacred text.
This may involve repeated readings, comparative reading, use of reference works, note taking, and so on. No reading roll is required; if any reading roll was required, it will have
been made during the initial reading.
Such a study can take many months. At the end of such a course of study, the reader must make a roll for Sanity point loss appropriate for the tome. The tome’s Mythos rating is then compared with the reader’s Cthulhu Mythos knowledge. If the reader’s Cthulhu Mythos skill is below the Mythos rating of the book, they gain Cthulhu Mythos
points equal to the full study (CMF) number. If the reader’s

Cthulhu Mythos skill is equal to or above the book’s Mythos
rating, they only receive Cthulhu Mythos skill points equal to
the initial reading (CMI) number of the book.
Subsequent periods of full study may be undertaken, the
difference being that each study will take twice as long as the
previous one (double all reading times). Cthulhu Mythos
skill increase and Sanity point loss are applied in the same
way. In this way a single volume may be studied repeatedly
over the years, but each time taking progressively longer
than the last, and ultimately with diminishing returns.
In the summaries of Mythos books (see Chapter 11:
Tomes of Eldritch Lore), reading times for books are given
in weeks. The Keeper should never feel at the mercy of such
numbers and should shrink or increase them as appropriate.
An outstanding academic with pertinent language skills will
read a book faster than an earnest but uneducated jour-
nalist. Time of study need not be consecutive days, weeks,
or months. Note that for a subsequent study of a book, it
is recommended that the full reading time is doubled and
never reduced.
Only one tome may be studied at a time.
