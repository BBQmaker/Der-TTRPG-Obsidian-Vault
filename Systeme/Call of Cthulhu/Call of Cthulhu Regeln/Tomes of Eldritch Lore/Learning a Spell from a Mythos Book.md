Following an investigator conducting an initial reading of a
book, the Keeper will indicate the presence and summarize
each of the spells in a sentence or two, assuming the book
contains spells. The Keeper should not use the rulebook
name of a spell, but might instead offer a description like
“broughte forth a Great Winged Beast from ye void which
did sore crowde my place of busyness,” in place of the too
accurate and too bland Summon Byakhee. Likewise, a spell
called “the unremitting terror,” sounds a lot more credible
than Implant Fear. Suggestions for alternative names for
spells are listed in Chapter 12: The Grimoire.
To learn a spell from a Mythos book requires that the
investigator has at least made an initial reading of the book.
The investigator chooses the spell to study. Learning a spell
can take hours, days, weeks, or months (typically 2D6 weeks,
but at the Keeper’s discretion). Just as with reading a Mythos
book, learning a Mythos spell may be taken up, put aside,
and taken up again, as convenient. Usually a roll is called
for at this stage; however, the Keeper may choose to grant
automatic success, depending on the scenario.
If success is not automatic, the player should attempt a
Hard INT roll to learn the spell. If the player fails the roll, the
investigator has not learnt the spell. The player may ask to
push the roll, but must justify doing so; for example, the in-
vestigator might lock themselves away in isolation until the
spell is mastered. When thinking of consequences for failing
a pushed roll, the Keeper should be creative and include
Sanity point loss and strange magical effects—both upon
the investigator and their surroundings. If investigator is in
no hurry, they may continue to work on learning the spell
without pushing the roll. The timing of the next INT roll
is at the Keeper’s discretion (perhaps once per two weeks)
