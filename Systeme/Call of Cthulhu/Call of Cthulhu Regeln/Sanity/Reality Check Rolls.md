  - Reality Check

While reality checks are only usually called for on behalf of insane investigators, a player might call for one if they wish to “see through” what they believe to be a hallucination or illusion. To perform a reality check, the player makes a Sanity roll:

#### Failure: 
lose 1 Sanity point. This will immediately induce a [[Bout of Madness]] if the investigator is suffering underlying insanity. Any delusions are not dispelled.

#### Success: 
the investigator sees through any delusions, and the Keeper must describe what the investigator genuinely perceives.

On making a successful reality check roll, the investigator should see things as they really are and will be resistant to delusions until losing further [[Sanity points]] (thus preventing the Keeper from constantly throwing delusions at a player).
Successful use of the [[Psychoanalysis]] skill will allow an insane investigator to see a delusion for what it is.
