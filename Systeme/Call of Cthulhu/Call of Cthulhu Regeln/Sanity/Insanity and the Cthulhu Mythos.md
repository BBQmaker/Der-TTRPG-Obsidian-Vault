Insanity bought on by non-Mythos stimuli yields no [[Cthulhu Mythos]] knowledge. However, each time an investigator reels from Mythos-induced trauma (e.g. seeing a Mythos monster, reading a Mythos tome, or affected by a Mythos spell), he or she learns more of the Mythos, and this is reflected in the Cthulhu Mythos skill. The first instance of Mythos-related [[Insanity]] always adds 5 points to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] skill. Further episodes of Mythos-induced insanity (temporary or indefinite) each add 1 point to the skill.
