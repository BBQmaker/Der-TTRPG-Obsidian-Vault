While the investigator is sane, a phobia or mania acts solely as a roleplaying trait. For example, if the player wishes for his or her (sane) investigator to overcome claustrophobia and crawl through dark tunnels, the phobia won’t prevent this. However, while the same investigator is insane, the phobia or mania takes on a greater significance.

## Phobic and Manic Responses While Insane

Direct exposure (close physical proximity) to the subject of the phobia causes panic; equally, exposure to the source of a mania causes an obsessive reaction. For phobias, actions other than fighting or fleeing may only be made with one penalty die. This penalty does not apply to Sanity rolls or reality check rolls. While in a state of underlying insanity (see following), being exposed to the subject of their mania will cause an overwhelming response in the investigator. If the Keeper prompts the player towards some form of behavior appropriate to their mania, the investigator will suffer one penalty die on all dice rolls until the obsession has been indulged in some manner, or the investigator is well out of range of the stimulus. For example, while in a place that serves alcohol, a dipsomaniac would take one penalty die on all rolls unless taking a drink. Of course characters who fully succumb to their drug craving will be subject to the drug’s effects, such as drunkenness or altered states of consciousness. In such situations the Keeper may alter the level of difficulty of certain skill rolls (or impose a penalty die on opposed skill rolls) depending on the situation and state of the character. 

Successful use of the [[Psychoanalysis]] skill upon an insane investigator enables the insane investigator to temporarily ignore a phobia or mania (see [[Call of Cthulhu Regeln Übersicht|Chapter 4: Skills]]).
