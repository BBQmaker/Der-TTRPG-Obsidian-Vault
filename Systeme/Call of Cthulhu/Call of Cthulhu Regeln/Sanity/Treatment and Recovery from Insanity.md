Temporary insanity ends quickly enough that schedules of treatment are not realistic. On the other hand, treatment of permanent insanity mostly has no meaning, since by definition the character will never recover, no matter how good the facility (the character should be retired from play).
Only indefinite insanity offers real scope for intervention and treatment.

## Recovery from Temporary Insanity 
Temporary insanity lasts 1D10 hours. Alternatively, the
investigator will recover after a good night’s sleep in a safe
place. If the investigators are in a state of heightened ten-
sion (for example, standing watch at night due to fear of
imminent attack), the Keeper may deem that sanity cannot
be recovered.

## Recovery from Indefinite Insanity
After each month of treatment of an indefinitely insane character, safe from further trauma, the player makes a dice roll. Two sorts of care might help to get the character to this point: private care or institutionalization. In choosing, the Keeper and player should consider the character’s resources, friends and relatives, and past behavior.
Alternatively, at the Keeper’s discretion, indefinite insanity lasts until the next Investigator Development Phase at the end of the present game chapter (in a campaign) or scenario.

### Private Care
The best care available is at home or in some friendly place where nursing can be tender, considerate, and where there are no distractions (such as other patients). Analysis and/or psychiatric medications may be available.
To determine the success of treatment with private/home care, roll 1D100:

A result of 01–95 is a success: add 1D3 Sanity points for psychiatric medications or psychoanalysis. This is followed by a Sanity roll for the investigator; if the roll is successful, the investigator is cured of their insanity; if the roll is unsuccessful then a further Sanity roll may be attempted in onemonth’s time.

If the result is 96–100: the character rebels against taking the drugs or therapy. 1D6 Sanity points are lost and no further progress can be made during the next game month.



### Institutionalization
The next best care is committal to an insane asylum. Asylums may be said to have an advantage over home care in that they are relatively cheap, or even a free service provided by the state. These institutions are of uneven quality and some may be potentially harmful. Some are creative places of experiment and advanced therapy, while others merely offer rude confinement. Supervised activity, manual therapy, psychiatric med-
ications and hydrotherapy are frequent, as is electrocon vulsive treatment (dependent on the period within which your game is set).

Psychoanalysis is unlikely to be available. Sometimes an institution may convey an uncaring sense that undermines the useful effects of psychiatric medications, leaving the investigator with a sense of anger and loss, and likely to be distrustful of outpatient support once he or she has left the institution.
To determine the success of treatment within an institu-
tion, roll 1D100:
A result of 01–50* is a success: add 1D3 Sanity points for psychiatric medications and/or therapy. This is followed by a Sanity roll, if the Sanity roll is successful, the investigator is cured of their insanity; if the roll is unsuccessful then a further Sanity roll may be attempted in one month’s time.

If the result is 51–95: no progress has been made.

If the result is 96–100: the character rebels against taking the drugs or therapy. 1D6 Sanity points are lost, and no progress can be made during the next game month.
