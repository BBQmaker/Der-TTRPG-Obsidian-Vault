In Call of Cthulhu, insanity is induced by traumatic experiences and the ghastly comprehension that connects to the Cthulhu Mythos. The duration of the insane state depends upon the number or proportion of [[Sanity points]] lost.
Three states of insanity can result: [[Temporary insanity]], [[Indefinite Insanity]], and [[Permanent Insanity]].
Regardless of whether the insanity is temporary or indefinite, it will consist of three distinct game phases:

##### First: 
the insanity begins with a brief “bout of madness”, during which the player’s control of their investigator is compromised (see Insanity Phase 1: A [[Bout of Madness]], page @@).

##### Second: 
the bout of madness is followed by a period of underlying insanity, during which the player retains full control of their investigator; however, the investigator is prone to [[Delusions]], phobias and further bouts of madness (see Insanity Phase 2: [[underlying insanity]], page @@).

##### Third: 
the final phase is recovery (see [[Treatment and Recovery from Insanity]], page @@).
