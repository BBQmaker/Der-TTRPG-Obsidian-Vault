The threat of insanity in Call of Cthulhu characterizes the Cthulhu Mythos in a way that allows no compromise.
Exposed to it, few sane humans freely choose the Mythos, for the Mythos is intrinsically loathsome and foul. The connection of Sanity points and Cthulhu Mythos skill points emphasizes the power of the Mythos, which corrupts and ruins by proximity and association.
An investigator’s Sanity points may rise and fall during play; however, it may never rise above the character’s maximum Sanity rating. Each investigator has a maximum Sanity point value that begins at 99. Knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos always lowers an investigator’s maximum [[Sanity points]]. Maximum Sanity points equal 99 minus current
Cthulhu Mythos points (99–[[Cthulhu Mythos]] skill).
When gaining Cthulhu Mythos skill points, the player should decrease the investigator’s maximum Sanity by the same amount.
