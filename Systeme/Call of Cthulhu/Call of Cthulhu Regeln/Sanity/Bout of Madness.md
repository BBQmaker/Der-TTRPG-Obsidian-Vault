On becoming insane, the investigator experiences a bout of madness. While experiencing a bout of madness, the investigator loses all self-control. In game terms this means that control of the investigator is handed from the player to the Keeper (for a short amount of real-world time). It is up to the Keeper whether this control takes the form of dictating specific actions or if it means giving the player guidelines on how to play out the madness for however long it may last. On the upside, the investigator cannot lose further Sanity points while experiencing a bout of madness. The mind is completely unhinged at this point and any subsequent horrors are either forgotten or later believed to be a manifestation of the madness. This protection is limited—the bout of madness lasts 1D10 combat rounds (‘real time’) if being played out, but may be longer, in which case the bout is summarized by the Keeper.
Each time an investigator suffers a bout of madness, the Keeper may amend one of the investigator’s backstory entries or add a new one. These alterations serve two purposes.
The first is to reflect the investigator’s descent in to madness by adding irrational entries or corrupting existing ones.
Second, entries can be added or altered to reflect events in the story and thus tie the investigator in to the plot more strongly. The player and Keeper should work together to add or revise backstory entries appropriately.
