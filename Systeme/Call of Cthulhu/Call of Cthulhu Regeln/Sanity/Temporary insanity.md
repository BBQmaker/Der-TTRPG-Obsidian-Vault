If an investigator loses 5 or more [[Sanity points]] as the result of one Sanity roll, sufficient emotional trauma has been suffered that the Keeper must test the investigator’s sanity. The Keeper asks for an Intelligence (INT) roll. If the roll is failed, the investigator has repressed the memory (a trick the mind uses to protect itself), and does not become insane. Perversely, if the INT roll succeeds, the investigator recognizes the full significance of what has been seen or experienced and goes temporarily insane. The effects of temporary insanity begin immediately and last for 1D10 hours.
