The following is a guide for how the loss of [[Sanity points]] might be characterized and can be used to complement and add color to the other rules described in this chapter (note that the effects may accumulate).

1—2 points: discomfort and unease, something gnawing at the corner of the mind—hardly noticeable, yet definitely there.

3—4 points: disgust, or the feeling that something is wrong here. This may manifest in vomiting, momentary stupefaction, or shivering.

5—9 points: fear, panic, or disorientation—enough to cause a potential episode of [[Temporary insanity]]. This represents a major shock leading to uncontrollable physical
reactions (violent body ticks, extreme nausea, etc.) and/or disassociation with surroundings and people.

10—19 points: mind-warping horror—hair changes to white, violent physical reaction (to self and/or others), physical and mental shutdown, sudden character change (temporary), raving and delusions, or propensity to either violence or total fear.

20+ points: ultimate cosmic evil—beyond humanity’s ability to comprehend. The mind is broken and will take a long time to return to sanity, and even if a way can be found, the person will never be the same again. Results in certain [[Indefinite Insanity]].
