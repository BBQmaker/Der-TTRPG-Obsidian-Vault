While not in control of the investigator’s actions, the Keeper is free to present an investigator suffering [[underlying insanity]] with delusional sensory information at any time. The only way for the player to be sure of what his or her insane investigator is seeing, hearing, touching, feeling or smelling is to make a “[[Reality Check Rolls|Reality Check]]”.
Delusions have greater impact when they have some relevance to the investigator. A great way to do this is to refer to the investigator’s backstory and use some aspect as inspiration for delusions. An investigator’s late spouse calling on the telephone is much more engaging than random delusions. Delusions can also make great consequences when a player of an investigator suffering underlying insanity fails a Pushed skill roll.
