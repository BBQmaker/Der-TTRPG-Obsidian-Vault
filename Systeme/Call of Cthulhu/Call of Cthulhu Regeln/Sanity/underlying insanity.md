Once the initial [[Bout of Madness]] is over, the investigator enters a lower-level state of underlying insanity. Control of the investigator is placed firmly in the hands of the player, who may freely choose how to roleplay being insane. While the player is not compelled to do so, aspects of the initial [[Bout of Madness]] might be reincorporated for the duration of the [[underlying insanity]]. While in the fragile state of underlying insanity (after the initial [[Bout of Madness]] has passed) any further loss of [[Sanity points]] (even a single point) will result in another [[Bout of Madness]]. This mental fragility remains for the full duration of the insanity—1D10 hours in the case of [[Temporary insanity]]—and probably for the duration of the scenario or chapter of the campaign in the case of indefinite insanity. It is important to note that the investigator, whilst insane, may act completely rationally and normally, only outwardly presenting their insanity during bouts of madness. Further advice on roleplaying insane characters is provided in [[Call of Cthulhu Regeln Übersicht|Chapter 10: Playing the Game]] (see Failed Sanity Rolls, page @@).
