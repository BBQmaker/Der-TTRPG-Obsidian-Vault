When [[Sanity points]] are reduced to zero the investigator is permanently and incurably insane and ceases to be a player character. In the real world, all insanity is indefinite insanity, since no one in real life can hope to predict the future as accurately as a Call of Cthulhu Keeper can. 
Many disorders, especially congenital conditions, offer little hope of recovery. Lovecraft concludes more than one story with the intimation that a lifetime of madness for the
narrator will follow.
Every Keeper must work out what the end-point of madness is in the game. Now and then a quiet release might be made from a local asylum. Some thin, unnaturally pallid person, almost unrecognizable after soul-wracking terrors, can walk shyly into downtown Arkham or elsewhere, cast keen eyes about, and attempt to regain some semblance of his or her former life—however, no player should count on such privilege as a right.
