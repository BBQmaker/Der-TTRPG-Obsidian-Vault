On losing a fifth or more of current [[Sanity points]] in one game “day”, the investigator becomes indefinitely insane. No investigator is simply able to shrug off this amount of sanity drain. A “day” in this instance is defined by the Keeper, usually lasting until the investigator reaches a place of safety in which they can rest and recover their wits. Depending on the situation, it may mean surviving until dawn, sitting down for a nice cup of tea or having a good night’s sleep. Indefinite insanity lasts until the character is cured or recovers
(see [[Treatment and Recovery from Insanity|Recovery from Indefinite Insanity]], page @@).
