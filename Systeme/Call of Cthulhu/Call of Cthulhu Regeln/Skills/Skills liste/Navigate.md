### Navigate (10%)
Allows the user to find his or her way in storms or clear weather, in day or at night. Those of higher skill are familiar with astronomical tables, charts, instruments and satellite location gear, as they exist in the era of play. One could also use this skill to measure and map an area (cartography), whether an island of many square miles or the interior of a single room—use of modern technology may lower or negate the difficultly level.
Rolls for this skill may be made as concealed rolls by the Keeper—a matter for the investigators to attempt, and later witness the results.
If the character is familiar with the area, a bonus die should be granted to the roll.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level:
- Regular difficulty: keep on the right route; use the sun and stars to identify compass positions; map a small area of terrain.
- Hard difficulty: head in the right direction when there is no clear route or landmarks; map a large area of complex terrain.

Pushing examples: getting the map out and delaying whilst you attempt to work out where you are; going back to where you started from and trying again.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:
you get lost and find yourself being watched or ambushed by a bear; you go round and round in circles, and your companions stop following you (you’re on your own now…); you mistake the stars, and rather than getting away from the cultist’s search parties, you end up back at the cult’s hidden base. If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she throws away the map (as happens in The Blair Witch Project) and follows their intuition. Their intuition does not work.
