## Natural World (10%)
Originally the study of plant and animal life in its envi- ronment. By the nineteenth century, this study had long separated into a range of academic disciplines (e.g. Biology, Botany, etc.) As a skill, Natural World represents the tradi- tional (unscientific) knowledge and personal observation of farmers, fishermen, inspired amateurs and hobbyists. It can identify species, habits and habitats in a general way, and identify tracks, spoors and calls, as well as allowing guesses as to what may be important to a particular species. For a scientific understanding of the natural world, one should look to the Biology, Botany and Zoology skills. Natural World may or may not be accurateâ€”this is the region of appreciation, judgment, folk tradition and enthu- siasm. Use Natural World to judge horseflesh at the county fair, or decide whether a butterfly collection is excellent or just excellently framed.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: i Regular difficulty: identifying a particular species; remembering some common lore; knowing the best place to catch some fish. i 

Hard difficulty: identifying an unusual specimen; locating a rare species of plant or animal; remem- bering a very obscure fact or piece of lore.

**Pushing examples:** spending much longer (forgetful of the time) examining the habitat; tasting the unknown mush- room or plant to get a better idea what it is; consulting with the old woman in the village about the local wildlife.

**Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:** you spend long hours obsessively poring over books to identify the species; you get the facts wrong, and instead of the wasps be- ing repelled by your concoction of swamp mud and herbs, they are drawn to you (with painful results); you picked the wrong mushroom and find yourself, hours later, walking naked towards a policeman. If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she goes native and will be lost in the wilderness until friends come to their aid.
