## Cryptography (01%)
The study of secret codes and languag- es developed by one or more persons to conceal the contents of a conversation or message. A specialized branch of math- ematics, this skill enables the identification, creation and/or deciphering of a code. Codes are usually written, but may take other forms, such as a message hidden within a musical composition, graphic art or computer coding (in modern day settings). Cracking a code can be painstaking work, often requiring lengthy research and number crunching.
