**Aeronautical Systems (01%)**
As progress marches forward, propelled by the needs of warfare, the complexity of aircraft also increases. This skill provides an understanding of the principles of flight systems and aircraft design, as well as the ability to operate, repair, and modify them, assuming the availability of the relevant parts and equipment. Attempts to repair an aircraft can be made using this skill without these, but treat as a Difficult skill check, and then only for the most basic repairs.

**Artillery (01%)**
Military characters only. The Artillery skill is required to operate any non-portable heavy weapons, such as field guns, tank guns, naval cannons, or shore batteries. As many such weapons require a crew to operate, attempting to do so singlehandedly is a Difficult action, and may be impossible for larger weapons at the Keeper’s discretion.
Specialisations: Aerial (bombs, bomblets, and torpedoes dropped by aeroplanes), Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Submarine Weapons (depth charges), Anti-Tank (towed weapons,
including the fearsome German 88mm), Direct Fire (infantry guns, tank guns), Indirect Artillery (including field guns,mortars and howitzers), Naval Artillery (including shore batteries), and Rockets.

**Close Combat (25%)**
Military and Espionage characters only. The infantryman’s best friend is his rifle, and many hours of basic training are devoted to teaching the use of the rifle as an effective melee weapon, particularly when attacking with fixed bayonet. Due to their training in the use of bayonets and other close combat weapons, investigators with the Close Combat skill
use this for all attacks with knives and bayonets, or when
using a rifle-butt as a club. Additionally, in the desperation
of battle the infantryman may use this skill to attack using
an impromptu weapon, such as a tyre chain or the faithful
Army issue entrenching tool (p.115).

**Combat Engineer (15%)**
Military characters only. Those with the Combat Engineer skill are experienced in the use of construction and demolitions under combat conditions, including building and
breaching defences, placing obstacles such as tank traps or barbed wire, deploying, detecting or defusing mines, and camouflaging emplacements.
Defusing explosives or mines out of combat is a Normal task but it is Difficult if attempted under fire. When defusing explosives, a Fumble (Critical Failure) indicates the charac-
ter has accidentally detonated the device. A Failure under peaceful conditions means the character is unsure of the device and must spend more time studying it before attempting to disarm it again next round. A Failure under combat conditions means the character in his haste jars the device, and for a split second there is the risk of detonatation unless the character succeeds in a Luck roll. Failure of the Luck roll means the device detonates, while a
Success signifies the character can catch his breath and try again next round. The Combat Engineer skill also allows the character touse specialist devices such as the Bangalore torpedo for clearing barbed wire.

**Command (05%)**
Military characters only. Rank may give a character the per-
mission to command, but only the Command skill gives him
the actual ability to do so. It allows a character to effec-
tively lead NPC troops in complex tasks, both in and out of
combat, as well as determining the skill level of the troops
under his command. For example, if a character has the
Command skill at 50%, then the troops under his command
have a skill rating of 50% for whatever activity the character
is commanding them in.
A successful skill use allows the affected unit to use artil-
lery, explosives, hand-to-hand combat, heavy weapons, rifles,
and so on, as directed by the character, but the unit must roll
separately to determine if the activity itself is actually accom-
plished. Any activity attempted by the unit must be within
reason for the type of troops being commanded—after all, an
infantry unit is unlikely to be able to repair, or fly, a bomber,
no matter what their officer’s Command skill level is.
The basic number of troops affected by the Command
skill is determined by the character’s rank. NCOs can only
command their immediate unit; a lieutenant can command
up to a platoon; a captain can command up to a company;
and a major can command up to a battalion. An enlisted
man can attempt to use Command, but only at the base
percentile chance (unless he has spent character creation
points to obtain the skill), and only at the level of his
immediate unit.
Any unattached units encountered in the field can also
be controlled using this skill, as can those whose command-
ing officer is outranked by the character, although characters
should treat this roll as Difficult if the commander they are
attempting to usurp is well-liked by his troops.
Fumble: unit tasks become Difficult until the character
makes a subsequent successful Command roll, or for
1D6+1 combat rounds.
Failure: unit tasks incur a -5% penalty for 1D4 combat
rounds.
Success: the unit acts coherently as directed by the
character.
Special: unit tasks receive a bonus equal to the charac-
ter’s POW for 1D4 combat rounds.
Critical Success: unit tasks become Easy for 1D4
combat rounds.
Attempts to command another type of military force from
the character’s own, for example an Army lieutenant attempt-
ing to direct Navy sailors, is classed as a Difficult skill check.

**Comptography (01%)**
Computers are in their infancy during World War Two.
These machines are massive calculation engines taking up
entire rooms with their state-of-the-art vacuum tubes and
thyratrons, and require constant upkeep and maintenance.
The Comptography skill permits a character to operate one
of these devices, replacing parts as they inevitably burn
out, and ensuring that calculations are completed correctly.
Should a character have access to one of these rare comput-
ers, a Comptography roll may be made when working on
scientific or cryptographical problems, potentially giving a
bonus to once science, Cryptography, or Mathematics skill
roll. (This permits the cracking of complex or military codes
that would normally be impossible by the use of the Cryp-
tography skill alone. The time taken to crack such codes is
at the Keeper’s discretion.)
Fumble: the character’s attempt to use the computer
has resulted in a fatal error, burning out a number of
essential components. Not only are the computer’s cal-
culations useless, but the machine must be taken offline
for 1D6 days to repair the damage.
Failure: the character fails to deduce any meaningful
insights from the data produced.
Success: the calculations produced by the computer
greatly enhance the character’s project, giving a +10%
bonus to the next science, Cryptography, or Mathemat-
ics skill roll.
Special: the calculations provide great insight into the
project, giving a +15% bonus to the related science,
Cryptography, or Mathematics skill roll. In addition,
the character has discovered new methods for operating
the computer, and may increase his Comptography skill
by +1D6%.
Critical Success: not only has the computer produced
astounding results (+25% next science, Cryptography,
or Mathematics skill roll), but it has also provided a
number of insights that allow the character making the
skill roll to increase his skill by +1D6%.

**Cryptography (01%)**
This skill deals with the creation, deciphering, and cracking
of codes. A successful roll allows the character to encode or
decode a message but only if the cipher is already known.
It does not allow the character to crack military codes—
after all, huge amounts of time and energy are expended by
entire teams of specialists throughout the war to bring about
such miracles—but the Keeper can allow the breaking of
simple ciphers or poor quality codes. A failed roll results in
an unintelligible transcript, whereas a Fumble results in a
misleading, and potentially dangerously garbled, message
being translated.

**Damage Control (15%)**
Fires are particularly dangerous on ships and submarines,
and every sailor learns the basic rules of damage control and
emergency repair. Damage Control allows the character to
use fire-fighting equipment and direct others to ensure fires
are quickly brought under control.
Training in this skill also gives the character the ability
to repair critical damage to a vessel under combat condi-
tions to ensure that watertight integrity is maintained. Any
critical damage to a vessel, including hull breaches, can be
temporarily repaired by a successful Damage Control roll,
though the Keeper should treat blocking hull breaches as
a Difficult task.
Fumble: the character’s actions increase the severity of
the damage. Depending on the location of the damage,
the results could be catastrophic for the vessel.
Failure: the character is unable to repair the damage.
Success: the character temporarily repairs the damage
and, in the case of a hull breach, succeeds in blocking
the gap.
Special: the repair proves sound, and the character is
able to make progress with secondary repairs, giving a
+10% bonus to his next Damage Control roll.
Critical Success: not only does the repair fix the
problem, but the repair is good enough not to need
revisiting afterwards.
Although the term “Damage Control” is specifically used
to refer to such ship-board training and activity, the skill can
be extended to cover similar land-based activities, such as
the protection of large buildings and installations.

**Demolitions (01%)**
The Demolitions skill covers military or professional train-
ing in the storage, transport, and use of explosives (for
example, dynamite and TNT) in the field to achieve spe-
cific tasks, such as destroying bridges and fortifications, or
immobilising tanks. The ability to defuse a range of explo-
sive devices is also covered by this skill, as is a knowledge of
the use of timers and detonators, including fuse pencils and
other SOE favourites.
If the character has Demolitions at 60% or higher, then
most regular uses of the skill should automatically succeed.
Demolishing massive structures, such as bridges, dams, and
buildings, are Difficult unless the character has access to
accurate plans or blueprints.
Fumble: the explosive goes off while the character is
setting it, or too early in the case of a timed explosion.
Failure: the charge either fails to detonate, or does far
too much (or too little) damage.
Success: the charge does the expected damage. On a
successful Luck roll, any desired and feasible special
effect, for example blowing up a bridge, is also achieved.
Special: the charge does special damage, and any
desired feasible special effect is also achieved.
Critical Success: the charge causes the desired effect,
and ignores any target armour.
For those who have not had the benefit of military or
professional training, the Electrical Repair skill can be sub-
stituted instead with the Keeper’s permission, as described in
the weapons table on p.65 of Call of Cthulhu, Sixth Edition.

**Diving (01%)**
Although equipment does become available to the public
during the 1930s, enabling the development of private diving
clubs, the use of underwater breathing apparatus for diving
during the Secret War period is sufficiently unusual that it
is not covered by the standard Swim skill. Diving, used in
conjunction with Swim, represents the ability to use breathing


cumstances the character should make a Diving roll on the
way down and one on the way back up to ensure no mishaps
occur, but if engaged in combat any activity must be attempted
at half skill unless a successful Difficult Diving check is made,
including making an attack. The Diving skill gives the charac-
ter experience in emergency procedures while diving, and can
be used to attempt a repair on diving equipment should it fail.

**Drive Tracked (10%)**
Military characters only. This skill replaces Operate Heavy
Machine with respect to military vehicles, and is the abil-
ity to drive tracked vehicles including half-tracks, mobile
artillery, and tanks in normal conditions. Driving in adverse
conditions such as heavy mud or snow is a Difficult task.

**Espionage (01%)**
Espionage characters only. This represents the character’s
knowledge of the methods employed in clandestine intelli-
gence gathering and covert operations. This includes evasion
techniques, signalling and counter-surveillance, the use of
dead letter drops and other secret methods for communicat-
ing, as well as training in specific operational requirements
and the concealment of activities in enemy territory. The
Espionage skill can be used for counter-intelligence purposes
to detect likely enemy spy activity, and for employing surveil-
lance techniques to catch them.

**Fieldcraft (05%)**
Military characters only. The Fieldcraft skill replaces Conceal,
Hide, and Sneak skills for military characters, and represents
the basic military skills required to operate in the field, such
as stealth, camouflage, and observation. Characters with the
Fieldcraft skill will know the best way to approach an enemy
position using cover to mask movement, how to cross rivers,
and how to lay down an ambush.
Fieldcraft also represents camouflage techniques, allow-
ing the character to obscure small firing positions and
booby-traps. In addition, it can be used for short-term basic
survival such as foraging and finding shelter.

**Folklore (05%)**
Knowledge of the customs, stories, and beliefs of an identifia-
ble area, region or people, such as a particular nomadic tribal
region, the Celts, or the Romany Gypsies. This knowledge is
primarily related to cultural traditions and legends, and can
be used instead of Anthropology to detect the historical pres-
ence of a particular people through carvings and other signs.

**Forensics (05%)**
Though criminal forensics is still in its infancy compared to
modern techniques, investigators with this skill are trained
to determine facts about incidents based on the scientific
evidence at the scene, while ensuring that evidence remains
uncontaminated. This skill can be used to search for finger-
prints and other hidden evidence at a particular location,
though this process is slow and painstaking so is unsuitable for
quick searches, as it takes many hours to complete properly.
A character using the Forensics skill can learn one
hidden piece of information about an incident scene for
each 1D6 hours spent carefully analysing it. This information
should be factual only, for example identifying the number
of people involved in a gunfight, or finding a fingerprint on
an iron poker at a murder scene. A Critical Success can pro-
vide a second piece of information at the Keeper’s discretion,
while a Fumble indicates the character has contaminated the
scene in his rush to find the evidence.

**Forgery (01%)**
Though in peacetime forgery is a crime, in wartime it is a
critical requirement in the world of espionage. Every intel-
ligence agency maintains a department of master forgers
capable of reproducing enemy permits, identification papers,
and incriminating documents. Assuming a character has
access to the right materials, or the ability to Scrounge (see
p.93), a successful Forgery attempt allows him to spend 1D6
hours producing one set of papers or one permit. If the docu-
ment being forged is particularly complicated or the character
has had to scrounge the materials then the check is Difficult.
Fumble: the character makes an unrecoverable mistake
while creating the duplicate, and must start again with
new materials.
Failure: the resulting document is good enough to pass
brief inspection, but anyone making a successful Spot
Hidden roll will identify a major flaw in it when used.
Success: the document will pass normal scrutiny, but a
detailed examination will reveal a mistake on a Difficult
Spot Hidden roll.
Special: the document will pass normal scrutiny, and
the character develops a “knack” for producing further
copies, giving a +20% bonus to subsequent attempts at
producing further replicas of this specific document.
Critical Success: the document is a perfect copy, and
even the most detailed scrutiny will fail to identify it as
a forgery.Though in peacetime forgery is a crime,
in wartime it is a critical requirement
in the world of espionage.

**Heavy Weapons (15%)**
The Heavy Weapons skill represents training in man-port-
able heavy calibre weapons, mostly used for anti-tank or
fire support in combat. Characters with military training
are assumed to have received general training in the use
of a number of weapon types. When choosing a specialisa-
tion, the character may attempt to use other types of heavy
weapon at half his normal skill value, representing his gen-
eral familiarity with these weapons.
Specialisations include: Aircraft Cannons, Anti-
Tank Mines, Anti-Tank Weapons (including Anti-Tank
Rifles, PIAT, Bazookas and Panzerfaust), Flamethrowers,
Light Anti-Aircraft, Light Mortars, Light Cannons, and
Machine Guns.

**Hypnosis (05%)**
The ability to place individuals into trance-like states during
which they are susceptible to suggestion, which can be used
to control addiction, change habits, and cope with chronic
pain. Attempting to place an individual into a hypnotic
trance requires a skill roll and, despite what the pulp Hol-
lywood thrillers would have you believe, the subject must
be willing, or at least not resisting (a variety of medications
can aid in this respect). Once in a trance, the subject can
be ordered to carry out simple commands, though the hyp-
notist must make a successful Psychology roll to convince
the subject to do something completely against character or
potentially hazardous.
Fumble: the subject in question and the character are
incompatible, and the character cannot attempt to
hypnotise this particular subject ever again.
Failure: though the subject was not hypnotised, the
character may attempt another session after a reasona-
ble amount of time (Keeper’s discretion).
Success: the subject falls into a trance.
Special: the subject falls into a trance and, due to the
strength of the effect, the character may put the sub-
ject into a trance at will in future without making a
Hypnotism roll.
Critical Success: the subject falls into a trance and,
due to the strength of the effect, the character may
put the subject into a trance at will in future without
making a Hypnotism roll. All attempts to persuade
the subject to act against character or in a dangerous
manner are treated as Easy.

**Institutional Lore (01%)**
Reflects the investigator’s knowledge of the workings and
intricacies of an organisation, usually that to which they
belong, such as a university or government department. This
represents the investigator’s familiarity with their organisa-
tion and the people within it, as well as their standing among
colleagues and their ability to gain access to superiors in
what is still a highly bureaucratic world. Assume the inves-
tigator knows any information that is considered common
knowledge, but for more technical or obscure knowledge a
check should be made.
This skill should also be used when attempting to cut
through red tape or to find the right person to speak to, for
example bypassing the usual bureaucratic chain of com-
mand to gain a meeting with the Head of the Department,
or convincing the postman to let the investigator deliver the
Dean’s mail for him.

**Mathematics** (EDU x2%)
A companion skill to Physics, this represents the ability to
carry out advanced mathematical calculations, and is an
essential weapon in the fight to crack enemy codes. A skill
of 20% allows a person to do calculus and analytic geometry,
while at 40% differential and integral calculus and non-Eu-
clidean geometry become understood. At 60% a character
is capable of creative, innovative mathematical work, and
would no doubt be quickly approached to discuss certain
special projects being investigated in New Mexico. Beyond
90% the character is at ease discussing his theories with Ein-
stein, but is perhaps more susceptible to SAN loss due to the
nature of his work.

**Meteorology (10%)**
Skill in Meteorology allows a character to predict local or
regional weather conditions for up to three days, provid-
ing they have experience of the area’s weather patterns. As
well as predicting weather conditions, the Meteorology skill
allows the identification of different weather effects, their
cause, and the likelihood of danger presented by them. A
meteorologist would also easily be able to detect any subtle
but unnatural weather conditions, such as unusual fogs or
strangely moving clouds, where others might miss them.

**Military Doctrine (05%)**
Military characters only. Military Doctrine represents a military
character’s knowledge of the armed forces, including ranks and
insignia, protocols and procedures, and concepts such as mil-
itary strategy and the varying schools of warfare. Characters
can use this skill to know a specific piece of information relat-
ing to military matters, be that the correct chain of command
to approach the Quartermaster General, or the standard pat-
tern of attack for infantry assaulting reinforced emplacements.
Characters can also attempt to use this skill when trying
to cut through red tape or justify actions that would be
considered against regulations. A minor infringement of reg-
ulations would require a Normal skill check, while a major
infraction against them would require a Difficult Military
Doctrine skill check in order to justify it, and reduce it to a
minor infringement; a second skill roll cannot then be made
to reduce this infringement any further. A classic example of
a character with a high Military Doctrine skill would be the
“barrack room lawyer” capable of spouting military regula-
tions to justify any action (or more likely any lack of action)
to superiors.
A Keeper can also use Military Doctrine to identify errors
in plans for battle proposed by the characters. Once a plan
of attack is decided, the Keeper can roll a Military Doctrine
skill test in order to advise the character of potential flaws.

**Photo-Interpretation (01%)**
The ability to analyse photographic imagery for specific pat-
terns and information, and to glean intelligence from images.
Training in photo-interpretation allows a character to iden-
tify enemy troop positions and other intelligence based on
aerial photography supplied by the RAF on their regular
reconnaissance flights over occupied Europe. Characters with
this skill may make a check to spot concealed enemy forces
and other features of interest from photographs, such as mis-
sile launch sites. In addition, photo-interpretation allows the
detection of faked imagery and alterations to photographs.

**Parachute (01%)**
Military and Espionage characters only. At the start of the war,
parachuting is still a relatively new concept for the mili-
tary, but by the end of the conflict and the huge landings
in Crete, Normandy, and the Netherlands, it has become
an accepted tool of war. The Parachute skill enables a char-
acter to successfully deploy and land via parachute without
injury. In ideal conditions, a character should only make a
Parachute skill check upon landing to ensure he does not
land badly, or else he suffers 1D6 Hit Points of damage on
impact. A Fumble indicates that not only has the character
landed badly, but he has also come to earth miles from the
intended drop point. In high wind or combat conditions,
a Difficult skill roll is required to land or make significant
course changes. Any actions attempted while parachuting,
such as firing a weapon, are treated as Difficult.

**Pilot (01%)**
The Pilot skill remains essentially unchanged from that on
p.73 of Call of Cthulhu, Sixth Edition, but the following
specialisations are available to investigators:
Pilot Aircraft—Jet-engine (military only), Multi-prop, Rota-
ry-wing (military only), Single-prop.
Others—Pilot Boat, Pilot Mini-sub (military only), Pilot
Ship, Pilot Submarine (military only).

**Perform (05%)**
This skill represents a character’s ability to perform in public,
whether musically, acting, dancing or singing, and may rep-
resent a pre-War career on the stage or in radio, television,
or even films. Though the BBC ended all TV broadcasts in
1939, their radio services kept the morale of the nation afloat
throughout the war, as well as giving the secret services a
channel for communicating with agents overseas. Characters
with this skill and a foreign language are ideal candidates for
undercover work, or as presenters for the many foreign lan-
guage services broadcasting propaganda in occupied Europe.

**Radio Operator (01%)**
Knowledge of the use of radio transmitting and detection
equipment, as well as the maintenance and repair of radio
sets in the field. Radios have quickly become essential to
ensure combined forces can coordinate on the battlefield,
particularly artillery and air support. Radio Operator can also
be used to attempt to break through enemy radio jamming,
requiring a Difficult roll to successfully transmit for 1D6
rounds through the interference, after which the enemy may
attempt to jam the broadcast again. Radio Operator also per-
mits the use of radar equipment (as it is introduced) for the
detection of enemy aircraft.
As well as radio operation, the skill includes the ability
to understand and transmit Morse Code at a rate equal to
one word per minute per skill percentile.
Naval characters may choose to specialise their Radio
Operator skill in Sonar, allowing them to use sonar equip-
ment to detect enemy ships and submarines. When
attempting to use either radar or sonar, a Radio Operator
skill check must be made, and adjusted to Difficult if the
enemy is attempting to avoid detection (such as in the case
of a submarine).
Fumble: the enemy contact has completely evaded the
radar or sonar detector, remaining hidden from all fur-
ther attempts to locate it, and receiving a +10% bonus
to its first action as it appears from an unexpected loca-
tion to strike.
Failure: the enemy contact has been lost momentar-
ily. The character may make a roll next round in an
attempt to reacquire the target.At the start of the war,
parachuting is still a relatively new
concept for the military.

— 93 -GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTYSuccess: the character has detected the enemy, though
must continue to make skill checks each round to
maintain contact.
Special: the character has a solid lock on the enemy
contact which may not evade detection again for the
duration of combat.
Critical Success: the character has a solid lock on the
enemy contact which may not evade detection again.
Any attacks against the target receive a +20% bonus
for their first strike due to the character’s excellent
tracking skills.

**Ride Motorcycle (15%)**
Provides skill in the operation of motorcycles and motorcy-
cle-sidecar combinations.

**Rifle Grenade (15%)**
This skill should be used for the indirect or direct fire of
grenades launched using a rifle attachment, such as the
American 22mm rifle grenade compatible with the M1
Garand and Carbine, and the M9A1 High Explosive Anti-
tank grenade. This is the period equivalent of the modern
skill Grenade Launcher.

**Rope Use (10%)**
Though the days of sailing ships with hundreds of yards of
rope securing their sails are long gone, every sailor knows
how to tie off a rope. Rope Use gives the character the
ability to tie different types of knot, and make use of ropes
for securing and restraining others, as well as knowing how
to get out of such restraints themselves. Characters with
this skill can use it to construct makeshift winches and lifts
between ships.

**Sabotage (05%)**
Espionage characters only. The knowledge and techniques
required to sabotage equipment and vehicles, with or with-
out explosives. A successful Sabotage roll indicates that
the user knows how to disable the equipment or vehicle
without explosives. It also indicates the best course for
maximum damage or delay, and can aid a Demolitions or
Combat Engineer skill check in doing greater damage or
being more effective.
Fumble: the character is discovered in the act of sabo-
taging his target.
Failure: there is little or no damage caused to the target.
Success: the target is disabled for 1D4 days.
Special: the target is disabled for 1D4 weeks.
Critical Success: the target is permanently disabled.

**Scrounge (10%)**
This is a survival skill particularly useful in inhabited areas. A
successful roll allows the character to “rustle up” food, small
quantities of fuel, and maybe even some useful tools, through
a variety of techniques: stealing, bartering, or otherwise appro-
priating (or rather misappropriating) items found nearby.
Scrounge can also be used in conjunction with other skills,
such as Mechanical Repair and Jury Rig, if specific materials
need to be found in order to carry out essential repairs.
This is not a skill for surviving in the great outdoors, as
it relies on having at least some degree of civilisation in the
vicinity to be able to scrounge off. Only items which might
conceivably be available in that particular locale can be
scrounged. You are just not going to find a wedding dress on
the Normandy beaches—unless you know exactly the right
people to ask, of course...

**Ski (05%)**
Training in the use of skis for downhill skiing, long-distance
travel over snow, and knowledge of correctly maintaining
equipment. With limited training, most people can ski in
normal conditions, requiring one Ski roll for each hour of
travel, though terrain and weather conditions may require
additional rolls. In combat situations, a character attempt-
ing to do anything other than ski must make a Difficult ski
roll in order to carry out another activity, such as shooting
a weapon. A Fumble result means the character has fallen
during his attempt to manoeuvre and risks injury, requiring
a successful Jump roll to avoid suffering 1D10 damage.

**Spotter (05%)**
Military characters only. The Spotter skill represents a char-
acter’s ability to work out firing coordinates for long-range
weapons.
The Spotter skill has the following specialisations:
Firing Solutions (naval artillery)—Long range weapons,
both direct and indirect fire, are affected by a number of fac-
tors, including wind speed and direction, distance, and even
the curvature of the Earth. At sea, they are also affected
by a vessel’s bearing and speed. As a result, considerable
calculations are required to ensure accurate targeting. A
character can calculate a firing solution for a specific loca-
tion or vessel, and attempt to use this solution to decrease
the range of one Artillery attack against that location or
vessel by one band.
Forward Air Control—allows a character to direct friendly
aircraft to attack ground targets without endangering allied troops. If the Keeper rules that air support is available at
any time, a map and radio-equipped character can direct air
attacks against enemy positions. Low visibility conditions
increase the difficulty of this to Difficult. Success indicates
that the air strike hits true.
Forward Observer (land-based artillery)—provided they are
in contact with the firing battery or its fire control, a forward
observer can attempt to adjust friendly fire. For each round
of fire, the forward observer can report and adjust the fire
coordinates by making a successful skill check. Each round of
fire that is successfully adjusted increases the accuracy of the
artillery fire by 5% up to the limit of the forward observer’s
skill. If the skill check is failed, the artillery has fired off-tar-
get. A forward observer can also attempt to call friendly fire
on a position if he is able to observe the target. A skill check
must be made to successfully relay the target coordinates.
Once fire has arrived, the forward observer can attempt to
adjust the target co-ordinates as above.

**Surgery (01%)**
The advances in medical technology made in the 20th Century have greatly increased the survival rates for men wounded in battle. All armies now field surgeons among their medical personnel, working in makeshift tent hospitals behind the frontline treating the worst injuries inflicted by the war. Characters with the Surgery skill are able to perform surgical procedures, often under combat conditions, to save the lives of the injured. Performing a surgical procedure at a field hospital is a Normal difficulty task, while attempting to perform a procedure under withering machine gun fire on Omaha Beach is a Difficult task, to say to least.

**Survival (01%)**
Knowledge relating to survival techniques for hostile and extreme environments, including how to dress, find shelter, safety techniques, hunting, foraging, and basic treatment of associated medical problems (such as frostbite or malaria).
This skill is only applicable if the character’s survival is threatened by the environment, such as by a lack of water, food, or shelter. When training in the Survival skill, the character should specify the type of environment he has been trained to operate in from Arctic, Desert, Temperate, Tropical, or Mountain.

**Tactics (01%)**
Military characters only. The Tactics skill allows a character to understand the ebb and flow of battle, and to choose his actions accordingly. The use of Tactics affects a wide variety of skills, including the choice of which weapon to use and where the character positions himself on the battlefield; attempts to use such skills without first using Tactics are automatically Difficult. Predominantly working at an individual level, Tactics can only affect larger troop numbers when combined with the Command skill.
Fumble: the character’s appalling tactical appraisal of the situation gives his combat tasks a -25% penalty for 1D4 combat rounds.
Failure: the character’s flawed understanding gives his combat tasks a -10% penalty for 1D4 combat rounds.
Success: the character is able to make an adequate tactical assessment, and his combat tasks are performed systematically in accordance with his tactical goals.
Special: the character gains valuable tactical insight from his reading of the situation, providing a +10% bonus to his combat tasks for 1D4 combat rounds.
Critical Success: the character makes sound and effective tactical decisions, providing a +25% bonus to his combat tasks for 1D4 rounds.

**Teach (10%)**
This skill represents the character’s ability to impart knowledge of a skill to another person. To teach a skill, the character must have twice the student’s skill percentage, or a skill rating of 50% (whichever is lower) in order to have the necessary ability to train it. A successful teaching session takes 1D3 days, and imparts one skill advance check to the student in the chosen skill.

**Telephony (01%)**
The ability to operate and repair telephone equipment, particularly field telephones and telephone exchanges. Knowledge of this skill allows a character to redirect telephone signals through an exchange, listen in on calls, and make basic repairs and maintenance checks to telephone handsets and exchanges. Characters with this skill may also attempt to place listening devices in telephones, and will be able to recognise the sounds of a telephone that has been bugged.

**Theology (05%)**
Theology is the study of the divine, and particularly the use of analysis and argument to help understand and develop religious theories. Characters trained in theology should specify the religion they have theological training in, and have an understanding of the doctrines, history, dogma, and teachings of their chosen religion. Characters can also use this skill to conduct services, assuming they are ordained ministers of their religion. Academic theologians may not conduct religious services, tending to be historians or archaeologists with an interest in religious matters. Characters with the Theology skill are likely to know more about other faiths than the average man, and receive half their skill for theological investigations of similar religions (Islam, Christianity, and Judaism all share certain similarities, while Buddism and Hinduism share a geographical and cultural basis).

**Torpedo (01%)**
Military characters only. The Torpedo skill provides the knowledge necessary to maintain, load and fire naval torpedoes, both from submarine firing tubes and ship-mounted  torpedo launchers. Torpedoes in this era are unguided weapons aimed and fired by sight, making them highly inaccurate weapons, though the use of the Spotter (Firing Solutions)
skill can greatly increase the chances of hitting a target. Firing a torpedo from a stationary vessel (either submarine or surface) is a Normal task; firing while moving is a
Difficult task. The Torpedo skill may be used to attempt to defuse unexploded torpedoes, though this should always be considered a Difficult task. Refer to the Combat Engineering skill for rules regarding defusing explosive devices.
