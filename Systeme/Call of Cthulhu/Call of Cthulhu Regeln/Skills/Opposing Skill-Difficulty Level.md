For each skill, entry notes are provided for which skill (if any) works in opposition, and suggestions given for what constitutes a Regular and Hard difficulty level. The Regular difficulty level (requiring a roll of equal to or below the skill
value) is the default roll. Where things are significantly more
difficult, a Hard difficulty level (requiring a roll of equal to
or below half of the skill value) may be required. Rarely
The investigators are trying to crack a numerical
code. The Keeper calls for a Cryptography skill roll.
A player lacking Cryptography asks if they can use
their Mathematics skill instead. The Keeper allows
the roll at an increased level of difficulty. A Regular
success was required when using Cryptography (a roll
equal to or under the skill), so a Hard success (a roll
equal to or under half the skill) is required when using
Mathematics in its place.
Look at the following to gauge a
person’s standard of ability with a skill:
01%–05%: Novice: complete amateur.
06%–19%: Neophyte: beginner with a small
amount of knowledge.
20%–49%: Amateur: possesses some talent or rudi-
mentary training (hobby level).
50%–74%: Professional: allows a character to eke
out a living from the skill. Equivalent to a bachelor’s
degree in a specific subject.
75%–89%: Expert: advanced expertise. Corre-
sponds with a master’s degree or Ph.D.
90%+: Master: among the world’s best in the skill.

should the Extreme difficulty level (requiring a roll of equal
to or below one-fifth of the skill value) be called for—only
in the most extreme and dire situations. Sometimes this
may be simply that the performance of the skill is greatly
hindered, such as when being shot at or pursued, or when
conditions are uniquely appalling.
Some examples of where an Extreme difficulty might be
called for include:
Demolitions: to defuse an explosive device of a radically
different design to any seen before, perhaps of futuristic or
alien origin.
Electrical Repair: working on futuristic or alien technology
that uses a form of electronics.
Listen: Eavesdropping on a quiet conversation in an ex-
tremely noisy environment.
Locksmith: Opening a high security lock with only a piece
of wire (i.e. no tools); crack open the most secure of bank
vaults.
Medicine: Diagnosis and treatment of strange, new, or alien
medical ailments.
Psychology: Read someone’s intent or determine that a
person is lying if their relevant opposing skill (Intimidate,
Fast Talk, Persuade or Charm) is 90% or above
