Fumble: a disastrous tactical error has been made by
the unit. Although it has escaped damage, the unit’s
blunder enables the opposing unit to achieve its
strategic goal for this combat, e.g. breaking through a
defensive line.

Failure: the unit’s attack fails, with no other
consequences.

Success: the unit inflicts a heavy blow on its target.
Reduce the opponent’s Troop Quality skill by 20%.

The number of troops or vehicles within the unit is also
reduced by 20% (rounding down), where possible.
