# Casting time and spells in combat
Some spells are useful in combat situations. 
Each spell has a casting time listed in its description: instantaneous, 1 round and so on.
If the casting time is instantaneous, it activates on the user’s DEX+50 (just like a readied gun).
If the casting takes one round, it activates on the user’s DEX in the present round.
If the casting takes two rounds, it activates on the user’s DEX in the following round, and so on.
